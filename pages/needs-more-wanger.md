# Needs More Wanger (2003)

![Cover Image]()

Needs More Wanger is the title of Interrobang Cartel's first album. By July of 2003, a half-dozen songs had been recorded by various Interrobang Cartel folk; [Tim Chmielewski](/tim-chmielewski) suggested that a CD be put together to send to "Weird Al" Yankovic and Dr. Demento.

Over the next couple of months, more songs were written and recorded, CD designs were proposed and discarded, and the name [Needs More Wanger](/needs-more-wanger) was decided on for the name of the CD. It was eventually officially released on 20 September 2003.

It was assembled by jwgh and had cover art by [Kibo](/kibo). [Not R](/not-r) provided some advice on the ordering of the tracks. Strangely enough, we didn't send a copy to Weird Al. Sorry, Al. 

We did send copies to the following places:
* The Annoying Music Show.
* Dr. Demento.
* This American Life.
* Rock & Roll 50th Anniversary.
* KTRU
* WBSR
* WDRV
* WFMU
* WHPK -- we have a confirmed airing!
* WJUL
* WRPI
* WUVT
* WVKR 

A web page was put together so that googling for [Needs More Wanger](/needs-more-wanger) would find it which contains instructions on making ones own copy of the CD plus an alternative track ordering.

### Why 'Needs More Wanger'?

The phrase first came up in a response [Dean Lenort](/dean-lenort) made to the [Free Your Cones](/free-your-cones) song:

> INSTANT REVIEW: Needs more wanger. Other than that, bang up job. 

Later, when [Talysman](/talysman) the Ur-Beatle submitted [Track 8](/track-8), in the ID3 tag for album title he put 'Needs More Wanger'. ZIP DRIVE CLICK OF DETH liked this enough that he ended up using it as the working album title for the CD.
