    they locked me underground the other day 
    threw me in a dungeon and tossed away the key 
    it's just for entertainment, they say 
    they say that I'm a whiner, they ridicule me 

    but hey 
    I can use this holiday 
    they want some entertainment 
    from my enforced containment? 
    then let'em pay! 

    it's dark down underground and kinda damp 
    least they coulda done was given me a lamp 
    I must avoid the lizards and bats 
    or maybe toss their corpses to try to feed the cats 

    I need to find a stick and 
    kill the rubber chicken 
    to wield while I'm still growing 
    and learn black pudding throwing 

    I wonder who constructed this maze? 
    built themselves a dungeon, then they moved away 
    and now I'm crawling through it in a daze 
    I'm just an angsty teen who thinks the scene's ok 

    but hey 
    I can use this holiday 
    they want to see me battle 
    fantastic deadly chattel? 
    then let'em pay! 

    another level deeper, oh no! 
    I fell into a trapdoor and hit the floor below 
    the mummy's gunning for me, I'm sure 
    I'm infected with disease and now I've got to find a cure 

    the air is getting colder 
    because of that beholder 
    thank plugh my power's growing 
    and I learned black pudding throwing 

    but hey 
    I can use this holiday 
    I'll rise up another level 
    and kill another devil 
    and let him pay! 

    NEENER NEENER NEEENER NEENER 
    la ti da ti da ti da da! 

    it's a good thing to be knowing 
    about black pudding throwing 
    today
