## Lyrics
    The price of Swedish glarno
    It goes up and down
    Sometimes it is worth more than a tractor
    Other times less than a bucket of slop
    No I wouldn't want to be a futures trader
    Who bets on the price of Swedish glarno
    It is not a reliable commodity
    On which to pin your future hopes and dreams
    The doesn't stop people doing it
    I see more every day
    The money is just too attractive
    I don't blame people for it
    But if you want my advice
    Don't mess around with the price of Swedish glarno
