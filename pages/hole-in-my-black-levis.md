# Hole in My Black Levis

Lyrics / Arrangement: [M Otis Beard](/m-otis-beard.m/

Album: [The Last Days Of The Crazy People's Supermarket](/the-last-days-of-the-crazy-peoples-supermarket)

[M Otis Beard](/m-otis-beard) relates:

    I finally found the adapter I needed to record at home using 
    my computer... so here's a new song! 

    Unfortunately, when I record this way, a LOT of noise gets 
    introduced onto the track. My recording program has a noise 
    reducing effect which I can use to get rid of the annoying pop, 
    hiss, and crackle... but it adds kind of a weird flange effect 
    to the sound of the guitar. Oh well. You'll just have to LIKE 
    it or LUMP it. 

    I decided to write a straight Country-Western song this time... 
    it was inspired by my MOO friend Roy, who greeted me the other 
    day by saying "I stumbled home this morning... I don't know where 
    I've been."

# Lyrics
    I stumbled home this morning 
    I don't know where I've been 
    It seems like one night's never enough 
    For me to get my fill of sin 
    I got a hole in my black Levis 
    And a belly full of gin 
    Please now honey, won't you take me back again? 

    Let's not get to fightin' 
    I can see that's where we're bound 
    Seems like one fight's never enough 
    Every night we go another round 
    I had my wedding ring in my Levis 
    Do honky-tonks have a lost and found? 
    Please now honey, won't you take me back again? 

    Well there's a whole lot of barstools 
    And there's a whole lot of shine 
    There's so many pretty women 
    Sometimes I forget about mine 

    I don't know what I was thinkin' 
    How could I be so cruel? 
    I was so wrong, honey you were so right 
    And you sent me straight back to school 
    If you'll just bail me out, Colleen 
    I'm gonna get right on the Golden Rule 
    Please now honey, won't you take me back again? 

    There's a whole lot of barstools 
    And a whole lot of shine 
    There's so many pretty women 
    Sometimes I forget about mine 

    'Cause there's a hole in the ozone 
    A hole in the bottom of the sea 
    There's a hole in my black Levis 
    There's a hole runnin' straight through you and me 

    I'm gonna stumble home tomorrow morning 
    I won't know where I've been 
    It seems like one night's never enough 
    For me to get my fill of sin 
    I'm gonna fall right off of that wagon 
    So quick it's gonna make your head spin 

    And when I come home honey, won't you take me back again... 
    Again?
