At the top of the left side bar there is a new section with Start Player button.  This brings up a new window with the new Interrobang Cartel Music Player.  It is a flash based player so you may need to make sure you have the plugin installed.  It plays all of the available songs from the site.  

UPDATE - I resolved all the broken links.
