# Dainty Toffee

Arrangement: [Charlie](/charlie)

Lyrics: [Tim Chmielewski](/tim-chmielewski) / [Nicko](/nicko)

Album: [Bad Coelacanth](/bad-coelacanth)

There are two sets of lyrics for this section of the Bad Coelacanth album, one set by Tim Chmielewski, the other by Nicko. Although there have been multiple versions of ?! songs before, Talysman suggests that this would be interesting if one set of lyrics is superimposed on the other set, especially since the part that immediately follows the tongue click in Chuma's lyrics would work as muffled speaking (as if by someone singing with a mouthful of toffee.)

also, Doctroid suggests that the "Ging ... Ging ... Ging" part should be a remake of the "Beep" song from the Needs More Wanger album.

## [Nicko's](/nicko) lyrics:

    About 11000 people like dainty toffee.
    About 11000 people like dainty toffee.
    dainty toffee really whoops a camel's ass.
    I like you a lot in the long run.

        DAINTY TOFFEE!!! 
        DAINTY TOFFEE!!! 
        DAINTY TOFFEE!!! 
        DAINTY TOFFEE!!! 


    dainty toffee really whoops a donkey's ass.
    About 11000 people like dainty toffee.
    dainty toffee is the best.
    You can really jam harder like a magicist.

        DAINTY TOFFEE!!! 
        DAINTY TOFFEE!!! 
        DAINTY TOFFEE!!! 
        DAINTY TOFFEE!!! 

    I like dainty toffee a lot.
    You make the joyride music.
    You are the archie pu king.
    dainty toffee is very special to me.

    Rock over London,
    Rock on Chicago.

    Pontiac - we build excitement.
