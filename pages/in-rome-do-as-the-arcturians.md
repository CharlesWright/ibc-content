## Lyrics

By [Doctroid](/doctroid)

> In the center of the Coliseum
> We who are about to die
> All salute the ones who've come to see them
> No one really knows just why

> Got a feeling that we don't belong here
> Really don't know who we are
> Got a feeling that there's something wrong here
> Gladiators from the stars

> When in Rome
> People have expectations
> Can't go round being different
> Can't go round asking questions

> When in Rome
> People hate indiscretions
> Can't go round acting crazy
> Can't go round with intentions
> To do as the Arcturians

> On the Forum by the Arch of Titus
> Chariots are rolling by
> And we're worried someone's going to smite us
> No one really knows just why

> Got a question that we want to ask us
> Is this premonition bad
> Now we're looking at the Circus Maximus
> Reminds us of a landing pad

> When in Rome...
> Pledging all our loyalty to Caesar
> Duty to dysfunction calls
> Isn't he just some old scheming geezer
> Won't his empire someday fall

> Things become more true the more you say them
> Here in post-Augustan Rome
> From the Milliarium Aureum
> Eleven parsecs back to home

> When in Rome...
