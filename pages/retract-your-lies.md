## Lyrics
    the sight of your username makes me squeal 
    RETRACT YOUR LIES! 
    I want to love you with six inches of steel 
    RETRACT YOUR LIES! 
    your rambling jokes fall a little flat 
    and I feel the need to tell you that 
    I've never met such a ludicrous prat 
    RETRACT YOUR LIES! 

    I avoid all froups you choose to infest 
    RETRACT YOUR LIES! 
    reading your prose is an endurance test 
    RETRACT YOUR LIES! 
    if draining the net of its soul 
    and spreading boredom is your goal, 
    congratulations, you're an asshole 
    RETRACT YOUR LIES! 

    buddy, let me tell you 
    you're a menace to the net 
    you get your kicks molesting kids 
    while high on drugs, I bet 
    so I'll follow you forever 
    and nag you 'til I'm blue 
    my sacred role is to call you a troll 
    and smack you with my clue 

    your continued existence makes me scream 
    RETRACT YOUR LIES! 
    it's all a part or your twisted scheme 
    RETRACT YOUR LIES! 
    my sock puppets and I all agree 
    a spelling flame should make you flee 
    or I will complain to your ISP 
    RETRACT YOUR LIES!

    letting you post is so unfair 
    it makes me yell and tear my hair 
    it's *my* internet, and I won't share! 
    RETRACT! 
    YOUR! 
    LIES!
