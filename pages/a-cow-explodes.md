    A COW EXPLODES!

    My milkshake is much better than yours!
    It has nitro-glycerine in it!
    Leftover from when the cow exploded!
    Who was feeding the cow dynamite anyway?

    You wacky Alfred Nobel!
    You deserve a prize!
    The Nobel prize for cow exploding goes to Alfred Nobel!

    PETA will not be amused!
    Who cares, it's the 19th century and they won't be around for another 100 years!
    Find more animals to explode!
    HA! HA! HA! HA!

   *fade away maniacal laughter*
