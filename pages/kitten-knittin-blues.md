## Lyrics

    goin' down to the drug store, buy me a skein of yarn 
    goin' down to the drug store, buy a big ol' skein of yarn 
    gonna knit me a kitten, even if you don't give a darn 

    got a pair o' round needles, listen to them purr! 
    got a pair o' round needles, hear them summabitches purr! 
    gonna knit me a kitten and cover him up with fur 

    don' want no store-bought kitten, 
    can't stand them kitten farms, 
    I wants me a homemade kitten 
    with all those kitten charms 

    so I guess I'll knit me a kitten 
    any color fur I choose 
    I can barely wait for my kitten 
    that's why I got me the blues 

    gonna knit me a kitten, just a couple more months to go 
    gonna knit me a kitten, just eight or nine months to go 
    gonna knit a siamese or maybe even a calico 

    I'm a gettin' closer, I can almost hear the mews 
    I'm a gettin' closer, I swear I can hear those mews 
    I can't wait to finish, I got the kitten knittin' blues 

    no, I can't wait to finish, that's why I got 
    the kitten knittin' BLUES!
