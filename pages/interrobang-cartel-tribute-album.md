[Casey B](/casey-b) suggested that Interrobang Cartel might one day record several songs that would later be covered by famous bands and performers as part of an Interrobang Cartel tribute album:

On Mon, 5 May 2003 12:31:29 +0100, "[Paddy Smith](/paddy-smith)" <pjsmith40 at hotmail.com> had the unmitigated audacity to say: 

> Just found this - the BBC have apparently been leaked the tracklisting from the new Interrobang Cartel double flexidisc album: 
>  https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2996793.stm 
> 
>  Does '[Rules of Naked Petanque](/rules-of-naked-petanque)' signify a prog-rock change of direction for the combo? It sounds ominously like a high-concept (i.e. gatefold) Yes pastiche. Whereas '[Static Caravan Fan Club](/static-caravan-fan-club)' is surely a spin-off solo project for a disaffected marimba player. 
> Nah, man, the way I figure it, this has fallen through a wormhole. Yes, in a vision unnervingly Wyld-Stalyn-like, we can see the future of Interrobang Cartel in the track-listing of this album - recorded in 2008 by several "old-timers" in tribute to the genius of the Cartel.

20. [Staffordshire Bull Terrier Portraits](/staffordshire-bull-terrier-portraits) - XTC 

> Of course, my crystal ball may not be very clear.... hey, that gives me an idea for a song! 
> Now, if we refuse to write any of these songs, will we distort the fabric of time and space? Are such time-travel paradoxes resolvable? Is the plural of paradox paradoxes? Discuss.

[Talysman](/talysman) later issued a challenge to complete all the lyrics for the huge pile of song titles people had suggested as the next Interrobang Cartel song. Unwilling to simply issue challenges without contributing, he churned out lyrics for most of the 20 songs listed; he also recorded [Sausage Calories](/sausage-calories), [Zoo Heaven](/zoo-heaven), and a rough cut of [Virtual Geese Honking](/virtual-geese-honking) as avant-garde sound collages.

[Tim Chmielewski](/tim-chmielewski) wrote alternate versions for [Zebra Races](/zebra-races), [Hedgehog Houses](/hedgehog-houses), [Tropical Fish Euthanasia](/tropical-fish-euthanasia) and [Monkey Origami](/monkey-origami).


[Talysman](/talysman)'s MP3s list the album title as "All Hail ?!: The Interrobang Cartel Tribute Album", which puts the Cartel in the odd position of recording a tribute to themselves. Here's how that came about: Sometime in 2005, IBC's record company issued "All Hail ?!: IBC Tribute Album". The accompanying press release described it as "a tribute to one of the music industry's finest bands, performed by world-reknowned artists and groups who credit IBC as one of their primary influences" but went on to say "the performers, in honor of IBC's paramount position in the musical stratosphere, have chosen to remain anonymous for this recording". This resulted in a frenzy of speculation among IBC fans worldwide, who eventually agreed (with near, but not complete, unanimity) that [Tropical Fish Euthanasia](/tropical-fish-euthanasia) was done by Radiohead, [Hedgerow Hypothesis](/hedgerow-hypothesis) by King Crimson, etc., etc. And supposedly "[Walking Stick Making](/walking-stick-making)" was the last song ever recorded by the late Johnny Cash.
And then someone said, "Isn't it uncanny how so many of those bands managed to have their vocalist sound so much like Casey?" and someone else said, "Hey, wait a minute..."

And sure enough, the hoax was exposed: The "world-reknowned" artists who had recorded the IBC tribute album were the members of IBC themselves, doing pastiches of nineteen other artists (and themselves). Predictably, about half the IBC fan base was outraged, burning their CDs (literally burning) in protest, boycotting the band's concerts, threatening to sue the band and the record company and Apple Computer, while the other half just sat back and had a good hard laugh.

But the final joke happened a few years later, when a reissue of "All Hail" came out. Someone said, "Hey, that doesn't sound quite like Casey..." And sure enough, it wasn't: the bands that had been imitated in the tribute album had secretly recorded their own versions of the songs as a genuine tribute album. Except for Cash, of course, whose place was taken by some guy who by then had made an international name for himself as a Johnny Cash impersonator (and whose idea the project was, actually).

Or something like that.
