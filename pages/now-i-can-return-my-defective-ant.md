    Hello Sir, pray do you see 
    the Gentleman who not half an hour ago 
    within the walls of this fine Establishment 
    did sell this very ant to me 

    This ant, you see, has got five legs 
    and though he seems to get about just fine 
    the box clearly indicates that ants have six 
    to compensate for having no spine 
    five legs, you see, are clearly inferior 
    and besides, i can see his interior 
    an ant with an intact exoskeleton 
    would for my purposes be highly superior 

    So pray, Sir, do you see 
    the Gentleman who sold to me 
    this very very very very very very 
    defective ant? 

    [clerk]
    sorry, squire, he's left for the day. 

    [long pregnant pause] 

    [Eric Idle]

    Then, Sir, could you be of help 
    I want to return my defective ant 
    and exchange him for another 
    that is whole in spirit mind and body 

    [clerk]

    Sorry, squire, defective ant returns 
    go past the volvox and the burpo 
    through the slunch appraisal area 
    and you'll come to ant returns 

    [music screaches to a halt] 

    [Eric Idle - speaking]

    oh, bother.
