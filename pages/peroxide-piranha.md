James Vandenberg started a competing heavy metal band named 'Shampain', which [Stacia](/stacia) mocked as follows:

    Oh look! It's a terribly effete fagort name *plus* a bad pun. 
    Lucky fucking you to have such a wonderful band name. Now, if 
    you don't mind, my little peroxide piranha, I am off to plug in 
    amps which will peel the pancake makeup right off your hairless 
    chests. 

This obviously showed that she could write better punk lyrics than any of us. [Casey B](/casey-b) suggested that the title for this should be "Peroxide Piranha". [Jeremy Impson](/jeremy-impson) then provided the following arrangement. [Talysman](/talysman) the Ur-Beatle and [Manfire](/manfire) later recorded it.

> guitar: loud
>
> drums: fast
>
> bass: throbbing
>
> nose harp: 
>
> shrilly theremin: spooky

Jeremy's note: "That's it. Play whatever chords you want." [Talysman](/talysman)'s note: "OK, I left out the nose harp and the theremin."


    Oh look! 
    Oh look! 

    It's a terribly effete fagort name plus a bad pun. 
    It's a terribly effete fagort name plus a bad pun. 
    It's a terribly effete fagort name plus a bad pun. 
    It's a terribly effete fagort name plus a bad pun. 
    It's a terribly effete fagort name plus a bad pun. 

    Lucky fucking you to have such a wonderful band name. 
    Lucky fucking you to have such a wonderful band name. 
    Lucky fucking you to have such a wonderful band name. 
    Lucky fucking you to have such a wonderful band name. 
    Lucky fucking you to have such a wonderful band name. 
    Lucky fucking you to have such a wonderful band name. 

    Now, if you don't mind, my little peroxide piranha, 
    I am off to plug in amps which will peel the pancake 
    makeup right off your hairless chests. 

    Hairless chests. 
    Hairless chests. 
    Hairless chests.
