 ## Credits

Sound Collage: [Talysman](/talysman)

Album: [Needs More Wanger](/needs-more-wanger)

## Background
[Talysman](/talysman) offered to be the avante garde guy that the band teamed up with for one song on one album, then got pissed off at, so they bitch about him in all the interviews. When [Casey B](/casey-b) later put together a list of who was in the band and what they did, [Talysman](/talysman) was listed as 'Avant-garde soundscape (track 8)'. So [Talysman](/talysman) put together a track 8 to put on the album; the track is officially named "Young Human Body Transplant 13" or "YHBT 13".

A bunch of items were suggested for inclusion in this track, such as William Shatner, Russell Crowe, a penguin call, a Wilhelm, etc., and [Talysman](/talysman) gamely included them all. He comments:

> as for the director's commentary, I think it would be  
longer than track 8 itself. I could always get shattner 
to do the commentary, because I think he's under some 
kind of curse to ridicule himself. either that, or milos 
milos gave him some powerful lsd. that would certainly 
explain "the transformed man", which is where "ophelia 
has been acting very strangely" comes from.
