## Lyrics
    the heavy skies were shattered 
    as the gray rain hit the ground 
    and all around 
    my life is moist with missed 
    opportunities 

    outside, emotions clamored 
    and the crowd was in control 
    they take their toll 
    but I can toss aside with pride 
    these indignities 

    yes, all of these 

        for I am far away 
        when life is gray 
        and I'm living in a world that few can know 
        somewhere else is where I am 
        and even though it seems a sham, 
        the only way that I can stay 
        is if I go 
        far away 
        when life is gray 

    my veiled delight is sheltered 
    far away from prying eyes 
    so I surmise 
    and none I'm sure will share 
    my affinities 

    my mind is blind with visions 
    and my soul burns with desires 
    that they inspire 
    my senses fade away 
    in their tapestries 
    of imagery 

        for I am far away 
        when life is gray 
        and I'm living in a world that few can know 
        somewhere else is where I am 
        and even though it seems a sham, 
        the only way that I can stay 
        is if I go 
        far away 
        when life is gray 

    far away 
    somewhere else I long to be 
    far away 
    where my life won't bother me 
    so I pretend 
    and my sorrows seem to end 
    if I go 
    far away 
    when life is 
    gray.
