Over the past three weeks the Barflies band has been preparing for a fund-raising party to generate donations to help us put on the show again in April.  (More money is needed this time because we want to qualify for nominations for a Barrymore award which requires a base scale for the performers and crew).  The show will be expanded with more stories and more music.

For the event we put together a set of 17 songs including bunch of extra IBC songs and some other covers.  Check out the [Belly Up Set List](/belly-up-set-list) for details.



Unfortunately the show was supposed to go on last night (Feb. 6), but due to over 24" of snow in Philadelphia the show had to be postponed.  We are looking at Feb. 19 (Friday) as a makeup date.



If you think you will be in the area and would like to see 9 original IBC songs performed along with opportunities to bid on great stuff, contact me for info:  cwright@spaceroom.org

There is a $15 donation asked for attending.



If anyone is interested in donating to the cause please visit the [http://www.vagabondactingtroupe.org/support.html Vagabond Acting web page] where information about how to do so can be found.
