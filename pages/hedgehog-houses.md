    through the green fuse, like the springtime rushin' 
    against my house the tree branches brushin' 
    ol' man winter just left a-cussin' 
    'cause he couldn't bear my constant fussin' 
    I'm spiney norman, all my friends are pigs, 
    when I'm in the wild, I stick to earthen digs 
    but if I'm really lucky, cute as a mouse 
    I can snooker my peeps to build a hedgehog house. 

    eeeky weeeky weeeky! scritchy scritch scritch! 
    I'm a hedgehog and I'll make you my bitch! 
    eeeky weeeky weeeky! scritchy scritch scritch! 
    I'm a hedgehog and I'll make you my bitch! 

    listen up, mister, I got a plan for you 
    if you want to please me, here's what to do 
    I don't wanna sleep on the naked dirt 
    so raise me off the ground or you're gonna get hurt 
    lay a slab or two under a rubber mat 
    make it nice and sturdy, so it stays kinda flat 
    set a box on top, fill it full of hay 
    then kick your heels back, light me up a jay. 

    eeeky weeeky weeeky! scritchy scritch scritch! 
    I'm a hedgehog and I'll make you my bitch! 
    eeeky weeeky weeeky! scritchy scritch scritch! 
    I'm a hedgehog and I'll make you my bitch! 

    I'm a boss hog, I'm 'bout to pitch a bitch 
    I'm a bad mofo, I'm a wicked ol' witch 
    ain't 'fraid o' no creature, be it live or dead 
    unless it's a tin can stuck on my head 
    I'm also kinda scared of a tiny kitten 

    when I hear one hiss, I think I'm gonna get bitten 
    better get rid of the family dog 
    'cause if fido is around, I won't be your hog. 

    eeeky weeeky weeeky! scritchy scritch scritch! 
    I'm a hedgehog and I'll make you my bitch! 
    eeeky weeeky weeeky! scritchy scritch scritch! 
    I'm a hedgehog and I'll make you my bitch!
