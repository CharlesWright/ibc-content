## Lyrics

    Oh, how I miss the Wumbles
    It was one of my favourite shows on TV
    And you can't go past the inflatable wumbles
    If you want to have a good time at a party

    Chorus:

    You can't go past inflatable wumbles
    Really, I mean it! They won't let you!
    Goddamn it! It's so annoying!
    Get out of my freaking way!

    I was walking down the street
    When the inflatable wumbles started following me
    GODDAMN IT! WHY CAN'T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!
    STOF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    Chorus

    I'm now living in the bowels of the earth with the dinosaurs
    Rick Wakeman comes down occasionally to sing a rock opera
    It's not much to look at
    But at least there's no inflatable wumbles!

    Chorus
