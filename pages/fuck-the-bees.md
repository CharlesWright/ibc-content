# Fuck the Bees

Lyrics: [jwgh](/fuck-the-bees) / [Zixia](/zixia)

Arrangement: [jwgh](/jwgh)/

Album: [The Last Days Of The Crazy People's Supermarket](/the-last-days-of-the-crazy-peoples-supermarket)

In April of 2003, a few people complained that, for a band that was supposed to be an International USENET Punk Band, Interrobang Cartel didn't seem to have a lot of punk songs written or recorded. Fuck The Bees was [jwgh's](/jwgh) attempt to fill that gap.

The lyrics went unrecorded for many months. Then one day [jwgh](/jwgh) was exposed to the Brooklyn Funk Essentials song 'I Got Cash' and he realized that the lyrics could be taken in a different, non-punk, direction.

The resulting recording was made in January and was assembled using Apple's Garage Band product. (jwgh speculates that it might have been one of the first thousand songs recorded in Garage Band, but there is no evidence for this one way or the other). A highlight of the recording might be the heavily processed whistling solo in the middle, which was intended to stand in for the theremin solo called for in the original written lyrics.

After [jwgh](/jwgh) recorded Fuck The Bees he then recorded a radio-safe version, [Swat The Bees](/swat-the-bees).

## Lyrics

    I get these headaches!
    After these gigs!
    They make me angry!
    You fucking pigs! 

    FUCK THE BEES!
    FUCK THE BEES!
    FUCK THE BEES! 

    Stupid sinuses!
    Why can't you go away!
    Worthless Ibuprofin!
    Why can't I get laid!? [<- NOTE USE OF INTERROBANG] 

    FUCK THE BEES!
    FUCK THE BEES!
    FUCK THE BEES! 

    I guess I could stop playing loud music!
    But that's just what they're expecting!
    Or maybe it's the pengins
    Hanging from my nose ring! 

    FUCK THE BEES!
    FUCK THE BEES!
    FUCK THE BEES! 

[THEREMIN SOLO, FOLLOWED BY A SCREAMING ROW BETWEEN THE GUITAR PLAYER AND THE SINGER]

    Maybe I could think of better words!
    If my head wasn't pounding so much!
    It's really hurting a lot!
    I can't even think of a fucking rhyme! 

    FUCK THE BEES!
    FUCK THE BEES!
    FUCK THE BEES! 

[A FISTFIGHT BREAKS OUT; THE SONG ENDS AMIDST CHAOS]
