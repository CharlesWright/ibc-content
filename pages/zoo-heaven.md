## Background

"Zoo Heaven" is a sound collage composed for the proposed Interrobang Cartel Tribute Album suggested by [Casey B](/casey-b) and [Paddy Smith](/paddy-smith). It actually clocks in rather long for an Interrobang Cartel song; [Talysman](/talysman) is considering redoing an abridged version for easier download.

The "lyrics" of the composition consist of [Talysman](/talysman) repeating "welcome to the zoo... welcome to heaven", interspersed by sound samples from various sources, including a '50s educational film, an unaired TV pilot, and a christian driver's education film.
