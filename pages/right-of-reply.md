# Right of Reply
In early 2005, [Talysman](/talysman) decided to alter a "draw me a picture meme-game circulating amongst LiveJournal users into a "write me song lyrics" meme-game, because he likes the idea of writing lyrics to random song titles or topics. He posted the following offer/challenge: 

>"Comment here and I'll pick one of your LJ interests and write lyrics, in a style of my choosing. 
You have no say in what I write for you, or the quality thereof. 
Put this in your journal along with the lyrics written for you. "

He got eight replies, and set out to produce the lyrics. A couple of them seemed humorous and likely material for the Cartel, but he was not intending on using the more serious lyrics. [Casey B](/casey-b) set him straight and suggested the album would be called Right of Reply. 

1. [Pretending i'm Somewhere Else](/pretending-im-somewhere-else)

2. [Kitten Knittin' Blues](/kitten-knitten-blues)

3. [Snowman In The Rain](/snowman-in-the-rain)

4. [Syntactical Soccer](/syntactical-soccer)

5. [Dancehall Dreams](/dancehall-dreams)

6. [Morris Chickens](/morris-chickens)

7. [Rogue Agent](/rogue-agent)

8. [Into One](/conent/into-one)


[Reverse Archaeologist](/reverse-archaeologist) was similarly the result of a challenge. Zusty suggested in ARK that someone should write a song "about how James is a reverse archaeologist for uncovering a retroactive future mystery." This challenge actually preceded the LiveJournal challenge, but retroactively seems to fit in quite well with the other songs. 

[Bacon All Over](/bacon-all-over) was an answer to another challenge, this time by one of the regulars of alt.slack. 

Other people have issued similar offer/challenges. More tracks may be added later.
