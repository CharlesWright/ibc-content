Lyrics: Matt Mc Irvin

Arrangement: Manfire (in progress)

Matt Mc Irvin suggested that Interrobang Cartel might want to use some of his lyrics for future recording projects. The first such song to be recorded was Chalice of Fire. POW-WUH would make a fine second McIrvin song, and an early demo by Manfire has actually circulated amongst some band members. It's an excellent heavy metal interpretation of the lyrics. Manfire is adding some finishing touches to the track.

Lyrics

    I post to Usenet every day 
    Fill cyberspace with POW-WUH!!!! 
    Everybody thinks I'm cool 
    Because I've got that POW-WUH!!!! 
    I'm the ANTIDOTE for BOREDOM, a 
    Convenience store of POW-WUH!!!! 
    I have a hairier chest than you 
    Because of all that POW-WUH!!!! 

(A million idiotic voices yell the refrain:)

    POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! 
    POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! 

    Nobody ever picks on me 
    They're scared of all my POW-WUH!!!! 
    Or steals the money for my lunch 
    I drive 'em off with POW-WUH!!!! 
    My gym teacher can't scare me 
    I triple him in POW-WUH!!!! 
    The bullies in the locker room 
    Start crying from my POW-WUH!!!! 

(Fireworks explode at the rear of the stage:)

    POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! 
    POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! 

    Whenever I walk in a room 
    The silence is from POW-WUH!!!! 
    Who cares if I can't drive a stick, 
    The other cars fear POW-WUH!!!! 
    My pimples don't repulse the babes, 
    'Cause they arise from POW-WUH!!!! 
    I don't even have to bathe 
    They only smell the POW-WUH!!!! 

    POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! 
    POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! 

(singing and music stop, so audience can chant alone:)

    POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! 
    POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! POW-WUH!!!! 

(Enormous power chord, and heavy reverb on the big finish:)
