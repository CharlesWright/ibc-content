# All Roads Lead Away From Rome
Title: Dr HotSalt / Mission Control and Zoev Jho

Arrangement: [Doctroid](/doctroid)

Album: [Rules for Dysfunctional Patterns](/rules-for-dysfunctional-patterns)

As the Cartel moves into its prog rock era, they take on a nerdly keyboards guy who, having joined the band, foists upon them a long, serious, intellectual, instrumental piece for the new album.  Not to be outdone by the gods of 1970s prog rock like Emerson, Wakeman, and Waters, he ventures into the weirdness of microtonal 15-tone equal temperament.  Needless to say, there is immediate talk of firing him from the band.
