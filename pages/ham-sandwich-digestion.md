# Ham Sandwich Digestion

    when you're in the mood for some food and take a break
    to make yourself a simple lunch,
    keep this in mind: when you find the speed to feed
    your need for something to munch,
    about digestion, there really is no question,
    it's useful whenever you eat,
    if it's bread, or if it's meat, or even squeat!

    when you make haste for a taste of meat to heat
    and eat, a ham sandwich is great,
    and I think you might like to bite a little bit
    of it and put it back on your plate,
    sammich digestion, this is my suggestion,
    is useful whenever you eat,
    if it's bread, or if it's meat, or even squeat!

    when you have a bunch of lunch that you must chew,
    please do, and try to take your time,
    just let the bolus thrive on your saliva, swallow all
    the ball, enjoy the taste sublime,
    it will finally rest in your small intestine,
    which dissolves whatever you eat,
    if it's bread, or if it's meat, or even squeat!

    EVEN SQUEAT!
