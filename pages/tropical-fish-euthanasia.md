## Lyrics

    do you remember how it used to be? 
    behind your glass, with you watching me? 
    I used to feed you, used to smile as you'd swim, 
    but time carries on, the future looks grim. 

    you are my fish, you are my guppy 
    but you were in pain that I couldn't bear 

    do you remember when I took you on trips? 
    you in your baggie fastened with clips? 
    I showed you the ocean, you smiled back at me, 
    but I waited too long while you looked at the sea. 

    you are my fish, you are my guppy 
    but you were in pain that I couldn't bear 

    do you remember how sick you became? 
    I spoke to the doctor, I told him your name, 
    he said I should kill you, you wouldn't survive, 
    and now I'm unhappy that you aren't alive. 

    you are my fish, you are my guppy 
    but you were in pain that I couldn't bear 

    you are my fish, you are my guppy 
    but you are in heaven, and I'll meet you there.
