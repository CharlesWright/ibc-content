## Background
Shortly after Interrobang Cartel was formed in 2003, there was a general call for lyrics. ZIP happened to have some lyrics about robots lying around that he had written for another purpose, so he contributed them.

[Casey B](/casey-b) and [Not R](/not-r) then recorded two very different interpretations of the lyrics (the '[http://interrobang.jwgh.org/songs/robot2.mp3 Data version]' and the '[http://interrobang.jwgh.org/songs/robot1.mp3 Dalek version]') and things were off and running.

Both recordings of The Robot Song appeared on Interrobang Cartel's first CD, [Needs More Wanger](/needs-more-wanger).

The last version was a cast recording from the fringe show [Barflies](/barflies)

## Lyrics

    I used to work at the mall
    Selling robots wall to wall
    Ones that cleaned and entertained
    A robot chef, a robot maid
    Then one night on a dare
    I made my robots /ware
    And it wasn't really planned,
    But now the robots rule the land
    And we're happier than we've ever been

    There was fighting, sure, at first
    When the bots conquered the Earth
    All the people thought we're doomed
    That by robots we'd be consumed
    But we humans had no chance
    Robots stunned us with a glance
    And after the human's final stand
    It was the robots ruled the land
    Now we're happier than we've ever been

    That's the last war that we've seen
    By decree of robot queen
    All the studies now do show
    That at ruling, humans blow
    Law's more carefully applied
    With a logic-loving guide

    Now with an impartial hand
    It's the robots rule the land
    Now we're happier than we've ever been
