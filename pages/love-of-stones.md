    I met this chyk by the name of liz slick 
    and she said she loved the stones 
    I thought she meant mick and I said real quick 
    that I liked their stripped down tones 

    she gave me a look like I was off hook 
    and she asked "what do you mean?" 
    I replied "in my book, rock can really cook, 
    if it's lean and if it's mean!" 

    but liz didn't mean the rolling stones 
    she said "fred and barney are my personal jones, 
    and you can't cook bedrock in a frying pan, 
    if you say stuff like that you're a crazy man." 

    so I thought "the heck?" and I rubbed my neck 
    and I thought "is she for real? 
    maybe I should check if she has a full deck." 
    so I asked "what is the deal? 

    you're a real cute chyk, and maybe I'm thick, 
    but don't you like the rolling stones? 
    cartoons are slick, but they can't beat mick, 
    he's got a sound to rock your bones." 

    but liz didn't mean the rolling stones 
    she said "fred and barney are my personal jones, 
    and I'm not really a rock and roll fan, 
    if you say stuff like that, you're not my kind of man."
