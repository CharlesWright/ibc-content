## Version 1 Lyrics

Lyrics: Terri Willis

Album: (unassigned)

Terri Willis (robot Terri, not meat Terri) wrote the following lyrics:

    Rock In My Shoe
    Rock in my shoe
    Hey, there's a rock in my shoe
    I got a rock in my shoe
    I should really take it out

    Rock in my shoe
    Don't want no rock in my shoe
    No good rock in my shoe
    Do I gotta take it off?

    Rock in my shoe
    Stupid rock in my shoe
    I hate the rock in my shoe
    Don't want to make an effort, but â€”

    I should really take it out
    I should really take it out
    I should really take it out
    Take it take it take it take it
    Out!

    Rock in my shoe
    Hey, there's a rock in my shoe
    I got a rock in my shoe
    I should really take it out

## Version 2 Lyrics
Major Zed version:

    I got a rock in my shoe
    A stupid rock in my shoe
    It started small then it grew
    I should do something about it

    I got ideas in my head
    Great big ideas in my head
    It's how I know I'm not dead
    I should do something about it

    I got some time on my hands
    A little time on my hands
    Enough to start my own band
    Maybe I'll do something about it

    (bridge)

    Hey you there lyin' in bed
    This song is rockin' your head
    It's time to hear what I said
    And do something about it.

    You can do something about it.
