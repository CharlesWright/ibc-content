## Lyrics

    the dancehalls mutter in my dreams 

    (everything grows, everything rises) 
    the century's bursting at the seams 
    (everything grows, everything rises) 

    high kicks, swirling skirts 
    multicolored laughter 
    rose red, swirling lines 
    burst in vibrant song 
    the gentlemen with hats of silk 

    (everything grows, everything rises) 
    dream of tasting mother's milk 
    (everything grows, everything rises) 

    sharp lines, curlyqueues 
    multicolored laughter 
    straw hats, swirling lace 
    burst in vibrant song 
    a picnic lunch spread on the grass 

    (everything grows, everything rises) 
    nudes and dandies of the upper class 
    (everything grows, everything rises) 

    top hats, monocles 
    multicolored laughter 
    floodlights, curtains rise 
    and burst in vibrant song
