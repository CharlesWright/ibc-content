# Rules for Dysfunctional Patterns
In March 2007, Dr HotSalt [proposed](http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.kibology/msg/3134039aecdf0ec6) a new album, [Rules for Dysfunctional Patterns](/rules-for-dysfunctional-patterns), based on a post by John Winston, quoting (apparently) from the book [E.T. 101: The Cosmic Instruction Manual for Planetary Evolution](http://books.google.com/books?id=CugDAAAACAAJ)  (also online [here](http://www.soulwise.net/et-101.htm)).
