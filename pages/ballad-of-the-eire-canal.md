Lyrics:

BALLAD OF THE EIRE CANAL
    From Buffalo to Derry,
    Three thousand miles and more,
    It was the first canal, me boys,
    What dared to stretch offshore.
    They said that we were crazy,

    They said it was in vain,
    For just as fast as we dug the trench
    It filled right up again!

    CHORUS:
       Some say you still can see them,
       Walking o'er the waves,
       Ten thousand mules, as many men,
       Each one strong and brave.
       And sometimes when I'm good and drunk
       I seem to hear my pals
       Calling me to a hard day's work
       On the good old Eire Canal.

    The mulewalk made of oak and steel,
    The channel lined with stone,
    But the winter storms in the mid-Atlant'
    You feel right to your bones.
    Fourteen good men died there
    Just a-building Iceland Lock
    And we buried them at sea, each one,
    Far from land or dock.

CHORUS

    The barges lined up on each side
    To cross that first spring day.
    The hundred-fifty waypoints
    Were stocked with ale and hay.
    And when in summer's heat they met,
    The westbound and the east,
    The celebration went right on
    For seven days at least.

CHORUS

    Eight years was all she lasted, boys,
    Eight years, two months, five days.
    I still recall the day they let her
    Sink beneath the waves.
    The sea was wracked by wailing,
    The mulewalk shook with sobs,
    When the Trans-Atlantic Railroad
    Cost us all our jobs.

CHORUS
