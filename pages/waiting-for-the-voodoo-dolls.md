## Lyrics

    (verse 1:)
    Can you explain, 
    why our lives are run by metal brains? 
    A billion monkeys hit their keyboards everyday, 
    we type away a paper hurricane. 
    
    Are we machines? 
    And if we are we must have robot dreams. 
    Malfunctioning between the twilight and the dawn, 
    our visions dance along on neon wings. 
    
    (prechorus:)
    
    If I climbed through a hole in the ceiling, 
    would it help me get rid of the feeling 
    something's missing, something's missing.... 
    
    (chorus:)
    
    But if the voodoo dolls 
    come in the mail today, 
    just in time, I had to say. 
    It's alright, it's alright. 

    Break 'em in half 
    because they gotta last. 
    Back of the shelf or else they go too fast. 

    I'm waitin' for the voodoo dolls, 
    I'm waitin' for the voodoo dolls. 

    (verse 2:)

    I must admit 
    my life goes by while I don't notice it. 
    I eat my ice cream then I see the empty plate, 
    I can't recall the taste a single bit. 

    Am I awake? 
    Or does the dream just take on different shapes? 
    I seem to remember something 'bout a girl, 
    holding all the light in the world, is that insane? 

    (prechorus:)

    If I climbed through a hole in the ceiling, 
    would it help me get rid of the feeling 
    something's listening, something's hissing.... 

    (chorus:)

    But if the voodoo dolls 
    come in the mail today, 
    just in time, I had to say. 
    It's alright, it's alright. 

    Break 'em in half 
    because they gotta last. 
    Back of the shelf or else they go too fast. 

    I'm waitin' for the voodoo dolls, 
    I'm waitin' for the voodoo dolls. 

    (bridge: spoken word)

    I really only come alive when I'm walking down the bricks to my mailbox. 

    The air is a dense medium that flows around me as I propel myself through a multidimensional space. 

    I stand taller than normal, my eyes and ears in a separate plane, parallel to this universe. 

    My arms and shoulders are charged with ionization as I reach for the handle of the mailbox. 

    Will it be there? Will it be there? That little gray box from the big gray box? 

    And inside, like sapphires from the moon, those ninety, perfect, little blue voodoo dolls? 

    (chorus:)

    'Cause when the voodoo dolls 
    come in the mail today, 
    just in time, I have to say. 
    It's alright, it's alright. 

    Break 'em in half 
    this time they're gonna last. 
    Back of the shelf so they don't go so fast. 

    I'm waitin' for the voodoo dolls, 
    I'm waitin' for the voodoo dolls. 

    (verse 3:)

    Do you believe, 
    your mumbled pleas defeat mortality? 
    I saw a speeding dumptruck full of cattle bones, 
    it had to be an omen, don't you see? 

    Am I to blame, 
    to chase away these thoughts of future pain? 
    I only want to find the formula for hope, 
    then toss it down my throat, 
    and watch the game.
