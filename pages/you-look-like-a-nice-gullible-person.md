## Lyrics
    Why do people choose me to do things all the time?
    If I am sitting in the audience, they get me up on stage
    I am the first person bums approach for money
    I am the one who runs errands at work
    The Mormons knock on my door first
    I believe that the word gullible is not in the dictionary
    I can almost hear them thinking as they do it
    "You look like a nice gullible person"
