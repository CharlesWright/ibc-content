## Lyrics
    mah daddy always told me 
    before he was locked away 
    "son, you won't have no problems 
    if you listen to what I say. 
    you got to take up whittlin' 
    to keep busy with your hands 
    or you'll wind up walkin' the wrong wrong road 
    wearin' the devil's underpants." 

CHORUS:
    well, daddy, I never want to be forsaken, 
    and I never want to take the crooked path, 
    so now I'm learnin' walkin' stick makin' 
    'cause I don't wanna face mah daddy's wrath. 

    mah daddy always told me 
    "whittlin' is mighty fine 
    to make yourself a walkin' stick 
    or carve yourself a sign. 
    you get yerself a great big knife 
    and a big-ass piece of wood, 
    and you carve away a ton of crap 
    'til it looks like you've done good." 

CHORUS:

    well, daddy, I never want to lose my bacon, 
    and I know I really need to prove my worth, 
    so now I'm learnin' walkin' stick makin' 
    'cause I know mah daddy's the best dad on the earth. 

(SLOW AND SPOKEN)

    well, mah daddy has gone and left me now, 
    and I think he's gone for good 
    the nuthouse came and hauled him off, 
    just like he knew they would. 
    but I think back on mah daddy's words, 
    how he taught me wrong from right, 
    then I pick up one of my walkin' sticks 
    and I hurl it out of sight. 

CHORUS:
    well, daddy, I never knew your heart was breakin' 
    and I never knew you were maybe a few bricks shy, 
    so I'm givin' up on walkin' stick makin' 
    'cause I know mah daddy was a kind o' wacky guy.
