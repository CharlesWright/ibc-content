# Beep

Lyrics, Arrangement: [Kerri](/kerri)

Album: [Needs More Wanger](/needs-more-wanger)

[Kerri](/kerri) recorded a song called "Beep" and provides the following commentary:

    I submit to you for inclusion in some Interr√∂bang Cartel thingie, the following song. It is called, intuitively enough, "Beep". 

    It's a commentary on how ANNOYING life is with all the things we have beeping at us. The timer, the alarm clock, the computer, the phone, and EVERYTHING ELSE. I'm sure it will make sense, in a lyrical context. 



The lyrics are as follows:

    Beep.
