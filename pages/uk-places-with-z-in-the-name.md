## Lyrics
    I was watching cable last night 
    lost in history on my tv 
    when a very pressing question in my brane 
    reminded me of geography orthography 
    and a riddle of a problem that once puzzled me 
    of UK places spelled with Z 
    with Z -- that's "zed" when said by british folks 
    who live in that country 

    it's funny how these questions come 
    into my brane like a chain
    of linked ideas that try to puzzle me
    again and again, it's quite insane
    and a riddle of a problem that seems inane
    becomes my sole refrain
    refrain -- that's a chorus in some songs
    you can sing if you don't refrain

    could someone tell me in engerland
    any placenames spelt with zed?
    until you do, this song will run
    in circles in my head

    someday I may set out on a trip 
    so that I can see what I can see 
    in the united kingdom, overseas 
    to find an answer finally scientifically 
    to a riddle of a problem that now puzzles me 
    of UK places spelled with Z 
    with Z -- that's "zed" when said by british folks 
    who live in that country
