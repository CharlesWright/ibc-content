##  Lyrics 

    In the morning she comes from a rose colored dream.
    A crying bacon alarm clock from the blankets she creeps
    She's holding a ticket to the nine o' clock train

    And all she could hear was the pink noise
    All she could have was a cold bay shanking
    All she could hear was the pink noise
    and sometimes she's scared of the street where she lives

    A cold chorus of classrooms, an endless echo in bells
    They want her to pay attention, but she can hardly tell
    She looks in their eyes to a mirror maze hell

    And all she can hear is the pink noise
    All she can have is a cold bay shaking
    All she could hear is the pink noise
    And a paperback chair is a lonely man's hell

    (break)

    Her racket of life has caught up and found her
    She can't stand the sights or the sounds that surround her
    She tunes it all out, and drowns in a Sahara
    And she could hear was the pink noise
    And the taunts of the boys
    And she has to pick up her toys
    All she can hear is the pink noise

    In the morning she comes from a rose colored dream
    A crying bacon alarm clock, from the blankets she creeps
    She holding a ticket to the nine o clock train.

    The pink noise
    The pink noise
    The pink noise
