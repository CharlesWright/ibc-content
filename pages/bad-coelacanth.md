    Wow, a whole new stubborn stain of IC track titles! Yipperino! I see a Bold New Double Album of Innovative Musical Pieces and Unnecessary Capitalization connected by a cod-operine narrative thread, along the lines of Zappa's "Joe's Garage".

This album MUST be recorded. The complete absence of lyrics and music and the lack of time, talent, equipment, motivation, organization and money to create them MUST NOT be permitted to obstacle our success.

I have utilized the management key success methods of SHOUTING WHAT I WANT, saying "utilized" instead of "used", and horribly verbing an innocent noun, so I think I have contributed all I can to the success of the project. If it doesn't happen now, it's all your fault, everyone. You will be hearing from my lawyers.

Oh yeah, and could someone design an album cover? Pretty please with sugar and threats?

All the best,

John.
