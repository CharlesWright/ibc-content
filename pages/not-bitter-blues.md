# Not-Bitter Blues

Arrangement: [Charlie](/charlie)

Album: [The Last Days Of The Crazy People's Supermarket](/the-last-days-of-the-crazy-peoples-supermarket)

This was [Charlie](/charlie)'s initial solo contribution to the Interrobang Cartel project.  The idea of Not Bitter seemed the perfect theme for a Bluesy type of song.  In the beginning there was an idea of lyrics but they never developed, so it has remained an instrumental.
