Since I have gotten a new laptop which means setting up my music software (again), I have to take inventory of the VST (and DXi) instruments that I use that did not come with the package.  I thought it might be useful to list various instruments perhaps with additional information about usage in works (patches, settings, etc).

For those who share projects such as [Major Zed](/major-zed) and I using the same software, know what VSTs and where to get them make it possible to actually exchange complete projects.  Eventually we can create a page that lists everything.

[Update 7/30]

I created a new book section [Musical Tools](/musical-tools) to organize information about software related to producing music.
