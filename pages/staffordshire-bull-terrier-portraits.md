## Lyrics
    paper-flat canines, antique kennel, 
    gilt-framed dogs frozen in their love, 
    eight by ten glossies 
    never need walkies 
    and never chew your glove. 
    no plastic covers for the couch, 
    no need for muzzle or chain, 
    in my experience 
    airbrushed obedience 
    never leaves a stain. 

    staffordshire bull terrier portraits on the wall! 
    they never bark at strangers, they refuse to chase the ball! 
    staffordshire bull terrier portraits I admire! 
    photographic goodness equals puppy love for hire! 

    when all the world's a biscuit 
    and it sometimes tastes like chicken, 
    canine photos 
    never eat alpo, 
    never watch the gravy thicken. 
    no tiny connastoga wagons 
    racing across the floor, 
    and tasty meats 
    are people treats 
    that portraits can ignore. 

    bull terrier! 
    aware of your 
    care! 
    dog imagery! 
    so willing to 
    share! 

    portraits on my wall, 
    reflecting petlike maze, 
    I melt like a rubber ball 
    beneath their canine gaze! 

    staffordshire bull terrier portraits on the wall! 
    they never bark at strangers, they refuse to chase the ball! 
    staffordshire bull terrier portraits I admire! 
    photographic goodness equals puppy love for hire!
