# Not R
Not R began life in late 1981 or early 1982 in a not yet formed band at Rice University called Youth in Asia for Sick Puns, later renamed to Åäð Nøyς. He was transferred into online existence on IBM's internal computer conferences, emerged again in a band called Not You and its followon, Limp Richard, and finally erupted onto the UNSENET in 1995. He has been known to burst into unwonted profanity when presented with a broken violin. In addition to not playing the violin, he sings and plays keyboards and electric elephant trunk. In real life, he installs VM software by day and sings [Georgian songs](http://users.bestweb.net/~notr/kartuli/), other [a cappella music](http://kairosconsort.org/), and occasional [light opera](http://gsmtc.org/) by night.
