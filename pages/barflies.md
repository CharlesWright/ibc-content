# Barflies

Barflies was a Philly Fringe Festival performance piece that took place in a bar in South Philadelphia.  Members of the cast were both behind the bar and in the audience.
The Barflies band performed a number of IBC songs as well as participated in the performance.

There were two "seasons".  The band also performed for a fund raiser for the second show.
