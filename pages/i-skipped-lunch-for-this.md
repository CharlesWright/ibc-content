# I Skipped Lunch For This
(unrecorded)

Lyrics: [Tim Chmielewski](/conte/e=tim-chmielewski)

Album: [Bad Coelacanth](/bad-coelacanth)

    What in the hell am I doing?
    Bent over the page scribbling
    I should be at the pub getting smashed!
    Or playing the ticket machines at the local arcade
    I have to play the Uncle Fester and Electric Chair

    Chorus:

    I skipped lunch for this?
    What was I thinking?
    I skipped lunch for this?
    I should have been out drinking!

    I could have gone for a walk down the street
    And waved to the owners of the pizza parlour
    On Wednesday I can go to the market and buy giant dim-sims

    Chorus

    On Fridays, we all go out for lunch
    So I don't get to do this
    It's a relief that at least once a week
    I don't have to skip lunch for this!

    Chorus

    I'm going to the pub!
