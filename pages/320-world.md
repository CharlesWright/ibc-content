Chorus will be shouted by everyone within the venue in which it is played.

    Fear, platter of the day
    nineteen bucks but more tomorrow! 

    Hurry out and make a fuss
    We love it all more share for us
    Chase a car! Crash a truck!
    People die, why give a fuck? 

    Chorus:

        Death! Death!
        Destruction! Death!
        Disease! 

    <Cut instruments, distorted & spoken (preferably by geraldo)> And now, Here's kittens! </d&d> 

    Here's a drug to make you live
    Not tested yet, hope U got time
    Sign up today, be a test case!
    Might save your life, might kill you faster
    Just hope we got exclusive rights
    To show you what'll happen after... 


    <drum, guitar fill-in>

    CHORUS

    Great new bug on the east coast
    Death toll's rising, what's it matter?
    Smile a little wider bitch!
    You live in california anyway!

    So here's the tall guy
    on the scene! Gasmask, flak vest
    He's protected. Man with a gun!
    Get the tape! Splattered brains!
    Bring it live! <shouted> Film at 11! 

    CHORUS

    <musical interlude>
    CHORUS
    <cut short>
    
    <crowd goes wild>
