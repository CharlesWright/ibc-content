## Lyrics
    Every Wednesday afternoon
    I walk through downtown
    To the videogame store to check new releases
    Even though I don't buy many games...

    Then onto the department store
    Where I walk through the perfume section
    It's for no reason
    Just to check out the sales assistants...

    If I had my own store
    I would have many obstacles to traffic
    Including having people stand one foot in the eepi department
    That would at least stop people walking through without buying anything...

    After the department store
    I walk through Chinatown
    To the Chinese bakery
    Where I buy Thursday's morning tea
    I swing by the Chinatown Cinema to check the new releases
    Then homeward bound on the tram
    It's slower I know, but I like better that way...
