## Lyrics
    Pay her no mind
    Per her no ear
    Pay her no mouth
    In fact, stop trying to pay her in offal!
    She keeps complaining to me about it
    I'm the one who has to listen to it all the time
    We can't be that short on funds that you have to pay people in guts
    What?
    You spent HOW MUCH on hard liquor and prostitutes?
    Okay, I'm going out tonight and need some funds
    Break out the tripe!
