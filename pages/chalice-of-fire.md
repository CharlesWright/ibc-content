# Chalice of Fire

(comments from ZIP: "Chalice of Fire was the first of [Matt Mc Irvin](/matt-mc-irvin)'s lyrics to be set to music (by [Casey B](/casey-b)). 

Matt describes how this song came to be:

  <b>SUPER AMAZING JULY 2003 NEWS FLASH:</b> A.r.k's own Casey B. recorded "Chalice of Fire"!

Note: The day before my wedding in July 2000, there appeared the eagerly awaited fourth Harry Potter book, which was something about a goblet of fire. They can't fool me; obviously it was actually a chalice. Apparently the nostalgic exercise reproduced below was actually a prescient glimpse of fin-de-si√®cle mania. I am better at forecasting trends than Trend Forecaster Barbie!

Either that or I was just accidentally pretending to be Unitarian.

I should also mention that I was definitely imagining the instrumental bridge of my song as having been lifted from the Steve Miller Band's "Abracadabra." But since it was all in my head, they can't sue me! The true Napster is in your mind!

By the way, Karlo Takki's quoted power ballad was the brilliant result of a challenge to write a song from vocabulary taken entirely from the headers of some post.

    Jan, if I can, if I may,
    I can be,

    With you.

    Aw, man, I hate how now these days all songs have to be about love or something. I miss the Eighties. In the Eighties you could have that kind of song, but you could also sing a song that was about absolutely nothing at all and made no sense, and nobody would even think that you were cerebral or quirky or David Byrne, provided that every individual word in the song was a sufficiently rad-i-kool word.



    As evidence I offer the following unrecorded song, which I wrote on the tour bus while I was the lead singer of "The Fixx," shortly before I quit and joined "Loverboy" because they had a better dental plan and more POW-WUH. I now consider this to be the anthem of a generation. Maestro?

An unrelated group of people had an entertaining and horrified discussion about the song which I recommend reading as well."

## Lyrics

[synthetic throbbing and percussion]

    She runs in the shadow of a motorized race
    The light of the fire in an enemy's face
    The moon flies a shiver of electrical night
    There's lace in the leather and it makes it all right 

    Ohhhh, and you're running
    Running on a serious wire
    Ohhhh, and you're running
    Running through a chalice of fire

    There's a shot on the water and a bolt in the heart
    Mind over matter is the dangerous part
    And the line in the mirror is a sliver of steel
    Now she remembers how the innocent feel 

    Ohhhh, and you're running
    Running on a serious wire
    Ohhhh, and you're running
    Running through a chalice of fire 

    A laser in the night
    We bring it to the fight
    Whether we're WRONG OR RIIIIIGGGHT-- 

  [cool noises for about twenty seconds]

    Ohhhh, and you're running
    Running on a serious wire
    Ohhhh, and you're running
    Running through a chalice of fire 

  [repeat and fade out]


### Commentary

CB comments:

    Hold on to your leg-warmers... 
    This is the Vangelis-meets-Ultravox-with-Simon-Le-Bon-on-vocals version. 
    AFAIK, there are other versions coming. 

    Oh, and the lyrics are here:
