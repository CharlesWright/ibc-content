## Lyrics

by [Doctroid](/doctroid)
    Saw a Buick Riviera, drivin' late last night
    I saw a Buick Riviera, drivin' late last night
    He was in the left lane and at the same time in the right

    He was drivin' in the fast lane, and he was also in the slow
    Said he was drivin' in the fast lane, and he was also in the slow
    Passed himself a couple times, how he did it I don''t know

    Goin' uphill was a dump truck, you could hear the gear box grind
    Goin' uphill was a dump truck, you could hear the gear box grind
    That Buick passed it on the left, and on the right at the same time

    Well I finally reached my exit 'bout the break of dawn
    Yeah I finally reached my exit about the break of dawn
    That Buick took that exit but he also drove right on

    I asked my good friend Erwin, tell me how can this be
    I asked my good friend Erwin, please tell me how can this be
    Erwin just laughed and told me, son it's no mystery

    You must have been driving on old State Route 89
    He said, you must have been driving on old State Route 89
    That road's just half an angstrom wide, stuff like that happens all the time
