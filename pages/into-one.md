## Lyrics

    and now will come soft rain 
    I hear the thunder and know its name 
    I seem to see my opposite 
    in moth-like stars and refuse pits 
    they're both the same 

    it's my life, it's my end 
    it's my foe, it's my friend 
    mother and daughter, 
    father and son, 
    all the world around me 
    bleeds into one 

    I gaze up at the sky 
    the sun's so bright, it makes me cry 
    I seem to see my shadow soul 
    in diamond's gleam and blackened coal 
    it makes me sigh 

    it's my joy, it's my pain 
    it's my body, it's my brain 
    fire and water 
    moon and sun, 
    all the world around me 
    bleeds into one 

    it's my tears, it's my breath 
    it's my hope and my death 
    start to finish 
    rest and run 
    all the world around me 
    bleeds into one
