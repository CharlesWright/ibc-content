## Lyrics

    She sits and sighs and pets her dog 
    It's cold outside, she wipes the fog 
    From the frozen window. Snow is fall-ing 
    Oh! What a dreary day 
    If only she could go outside and play... [vocal fades into sounds of laughing children] 
    Her daydreams all turn summerish 
    She sits and sighs and makes a wish 
    That flies so high the eye can hardly follow 
    Oh! Bring us a sunny day 
    Ninety-three million miles, so far away... 

(Fast and hard bit):

    THE SUN! SHE EXPLODE! 
    THE SUN! SHE EXPLODE! 
    THE SUN! SHE EXPLODE! 
    THE SUN! SHE EXPLODE! 

(Insane panicked jam)/

    Burning buildings burning trees 
    Burning faces burning hair
    Burning ears and burning air 
    Burning water burning sky

    THE SUN! SHE EXPLODE!
    THE SUN! SHE EXPLODE! 
    THE SUN! SHE EXPLODE!
    THE SUN! SHE EXPLODE! 

REPRISE/CODA:

    A dog is man's best friend tonight 
    Inside a dog there is no light 
    So wipe away that boiling tear 
    We'll all be safe and cool in here my dear 

[HUGE EXPLOSION]
