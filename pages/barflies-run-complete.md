A bunch of really good shows, though each crowd had different reactions to both the music and the acting elements of the show.  Overall there were a lot of questions about where people could find the music.  I made up business cards with the logo and the web-site.  Checking the MP3 page hit count it has done a nice jump so I am hoping it is from the crowd.

We finished up the show last Saturday (19th) with a 7PM and a 9PM show.  Both went really well.  After packing up all the gear we went to Tony's place for a cast party.  A lot of fun including Rock Band, Beatles.
We got home around 4AM, so a good party.

At some point in the near future we will do a recording of our versions of the songs.  I will post when they are available.

We captured video of many of the shows.  It will take some time, but I will try to get song clips from the best versions of the song once I have a chance to go through all the videos.

Already looks like we will do a rewrite/remount in the spring  (Barflies!:  A 2nd Shot) .  Planned to be longer with more music.  More will follow as things develop.
