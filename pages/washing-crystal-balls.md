## Lyrics
    someone dropped my future in creamy cheese sauce
    now my fortune's smudged!
    (fortune's smudged)
    reply hazy, answer unclear,
    my plans are ruined for another year

    you're a fine girl
    you make my toenails curl,
    so don't give up on me!
    sweet cherry,
    my life is kind of scary,
    please wash the stain from my destiny!

    I see illusions of the life I'd like to lead
    in my crystal ball!
    (crystal ball)
    but now it's dirty and unclean,
    please, let me use your washing machine

    you're a sweet child,
    you're gentle but wild,
    I wish you'd hear my plea!
    sweet cherry,
    I know that you feel wary,
    but wash the stain from my destiny!
