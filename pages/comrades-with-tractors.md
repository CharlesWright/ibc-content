# Comrades With Tractor 

Lyrics: [Tim Chmielewski](/tim-chmielewski)

Arrangement: [Talysman](/talysman)

[Tim Chmielewski](/tim-chmielewski) comments on his lyrics:

    This song is for Mr John Burrage and Interrobang Cartel can use it if they want it. I thought of it after watching the video clip for the Rentals "Friends of P." 

When [Talysman](/talysman) recorded the song, he had never heard of the Rentals, so he conceived of it being more like an A-ha! or After The Fire style new wave song.


## Lyrics

    ooh woo hoo hoo 



    He's got a brand new tractor 
    He's out planting potatoes 
    No time to stop and chat 
    The party rests for no one 

    It's not gonna go for no one 
    Only members of the party 
    It's good for all comrades 
    And I'm mentally singing 

    Oh yeah, oh yeah, what’s that you see?" 
    Oh boy, find out, what’s up with me 
    Oh yeah, oh yeah, what’s that you see" 
    Tell me, more of what's gonna be 

    If you’re friends with Tractors 
    Well then you’re comrades with me 
    If you’re down with Tractors. 
    Well then you’re down with me 

    Comrades with Tractors. 
    Comrades with Tractors. 
    Comrades with Tractors. 
    comrades ooh woo hoo hoo 

    Everyone's got loads of potatoes 
    It's a bountiful harvest 
    I only love the party 
    I will die when I'm 100 

    Oh yeah, oh yeah, what’s that you see?" 
    Oh boy, find out, what’s up with me 
    Oh yeah, oh yeah, what’s that you see" 
    Tell me, more of what's gonna be 

    If you’re comrades with Tractors. 
    Well then you’re comrades with me 
    If you down with Tractors. 
    Well then you’re down with me 

    Comrades with Tractors. 
    Comrades with Tractors. 
    Comrades with Tractors. 
    Comrades of Tractors. 

    If you’re comrades with Tractors. 
    Well then you’re comrades with me 
    If you’re down with Tractors. 
    Well then you’re down with me 
    If you’re comrades with Tractors. 
    Well then you’re comrades with me 
    If you’re down with Tractors. 
    Well then you’re down with me
