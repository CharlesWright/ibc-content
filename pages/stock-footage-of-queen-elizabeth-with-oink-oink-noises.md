## Lyrics
    Chorus:
        God Save the Queen!
        She's made of bacon!
        I'm not faking!
        It's on the stove baking!

    YAY! "In bed (the clown) with Elvis and friends" is on!
    The woman I wish was my girlfriend is hosting it
    She always looks lovely
    I had to hold the car steering wheel while she brushed her hair once

    Chorus

    I've lost my train of thought
    Oh, yes!
    They had to lock up the corgis as they were eating the Queen
    It was more embarrassing than Hitler Harry and the Chamber of Spanking!

    Chorus

    Monarchists will have a fit when they hear this song!
    Who cares? I don't know any!
    All my friends are from pubs
    Including the buxom wench barmaid I have a crush on

    Chorus

    God Save the Queen!
    She's made of bacon!
    I'm having a chip butty for lunch!
    I hope I don't throw up!
