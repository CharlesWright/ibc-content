:You mean like this? Now we just need music:





h2. God needs to do what God wants to do

h3. Lyrics



:Way back in the beginning,

:There is just one man and woman,

:They were made for one another - from clay and a bone.

:They have it made.



:Then someone ate an apple,

:Against Creator's wishes,

:They ate that crunchy apple but could not atone.

:They fucked it up.



:When you don't do what's been Spoken,

:God wants to evict you.

:God wants to evict you.

:God needs to do what God wants to do.



:In the desert there's a small tribe,

:Looking for a future,

:Looking for a land to call its own.

:Then they find God.



:And He shows them milk and honey,

:After they all have betrayed Him,

:After they carved all those idols out of stone.

:They blew it big.



:But when you have been chosen,

:God just wants to help you.

:God just wants to help you.

:God needs to do what God wants to do.



:In a small land on the ocean,

:Someone gets a hard-on,

:Someone gets his rocks off - he's all alone.

:He's pullin' it off.



:Then along comes a tsunami,

:Pounding on the lowlands,

:Washing away that sinner in his room

:In a big way.



:When you are a sinner,

:God just wants to kill you.

:God just wants to kill you.

:God needs to do what God wants to do.



:There's a planet full of sinners,

:Fingers on the buttons,

:Ears pressed to the headsets of their red phones.

:They enter their codes.



:And the missiles all are launching,

:Flying to their targets,

:Breaking up the planet - into small stones.

:The destruction is done.



:When you've got too much power,

:God wants to just start over.

:God wants to just start over.

:God needs to do what God wants to do.
