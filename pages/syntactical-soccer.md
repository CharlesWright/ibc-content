## Lyrics

    verbal sleight-of-tongue 
    slick with quick wit 
    and references to Jung 
    insert random sarcasm 
    allusion to orgasm 
    and finish with a pun 

    syntactical soccer 
    boot the ball toward the goal 
    syntactical soccer 
    fill the conversational hole 

    literate alliteration 
    trip of the lip 
    with assonance and rhyme 
    metaphor and simile 
    and a touch of sophistry 
    served with sage and thyme 

    syntactical soccer 
    boot the ball toward the goal 
    syntactical soccer 
    fill the conversational hole 

    (SFX: "GOOOOOOL")
