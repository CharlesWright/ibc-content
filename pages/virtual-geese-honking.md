## Song Info
"Virtual Geese Honking" is a sound collage composed for the proposed Interrobang Cartel Tribute Album suggested by Casey B and Paddy Smith (as an elaboration on a list of least-popular search keywords published by the BBC.) Talysman then created a "rough cut" that actually does include the sounds of geese honking jwgh added keyboard and guitar parts to flesh out the track.
