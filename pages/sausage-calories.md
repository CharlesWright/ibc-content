## Lyrics:

    88 Calories in Beef, Cured, Sausage. Cooked, Smoked. 
    blood sausage is 95 calories. 
    52 Calories in Honey Roll Sausage, Beef. 

    sausages should be fixed without milk, to avoid the fat, 
    nor should you cut the sausage nor cut the cheese. 

    houdini venison sausages can escape any danger, 
    french omlette sausages are fluffy like chickens. 

    sausages get crabby when exposed to gamma rays 
    or told to paint their toenails. 

    sausages, frankfurters, hot dogs, bratwurst 
    meat meat meat 

    you can associate sausages with visions of childhood 
    or even spankings 

    once you make a sausage, you can cook it 
    once you cook a sausage, you can eat it 
    once you eat a sausage, you can assume its form. 

    I once saw a man eaten alive on a sausage safari. 
    a full-grown sausage can strip the flesh from a medium-sized man 
    in a small amount of time. 

    88 Calories in Beef, Cured, Sausage. Cooked, Smoked. 
    blood sausage is 95 calories. 
    52 Calories in Honey Roll Sausage, Beef. 

    once you make a sausage, you can cook it 
    once you cook a sausage, you can eat it
