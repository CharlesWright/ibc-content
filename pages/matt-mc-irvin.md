# Matt Mc Irvin

Matt Mc Irvin has been one of the mainstays of alt.religion.kibology for quite some time; his capacity for explaining memes has inadvertently turned him into a meme himself, which is why he is mentioned in songs like Support the Lurkers.

He has also provided lyrics and vocal talents, as well as several suggestions, for a number of Interrobang Cartel songs.
