## Lyrics

    I can see your coal-bright smile 
    in the shadows of my dreams 
    the image of your icy face 
    still haunts my soul, it seems 
    though winter now is fading 
    and the snow now melts away 
    I think of you, my snowman 
    and miss that frosty day 

    snowman in the rain 
    I miss your frigid style 
    snowman in the rain 
    you still make me smile 
    yes, we only get one snowman 
    to live in our memories 
    and you, mister snowman, 
    were the memory for me 

    I can see your features 
    the raindrops have despoiled 
    your snowy skin has turned to gray 
    your snowballs are now soiled 
    your face is now misshapen 
    and your scarf has blown away 
    the winter thaw has taken you 
    and left a sunny day 

    snowman in the rain 
    I miss your frigid style 
    snowman in the rain 
    you still make me smile 
    yes, we only get one snowman 
    to be our childhood friend 
    and you, mister snowman, 
    will be mine 'til the end 

    yes, we only get one snowman 
    to live in our memories 
    and you, mister snowman, 
    were that memory for me
