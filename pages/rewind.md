## Lyrics
    travellin' down the road, thinkin' about the code, 
    and dreamin' about the days I spent with you, 
    you were always by my side when I laughed and when I cried, 
    but you're gone now, and those memories make me blue. 

    in the chill wind of november, my life is like an ember, 
    and a spark of hope is all that warms my soul, 
    to find you again, my friend, a message I will send 
    to my allies beyond the galactic pole. 

    because my warp field generation 
    puts out so much radiation 
    my chronetic destination seems unreal, 
    I need dimensional assistance 
    to cross the temporal distance 
    and overcome the resistance that I feel. 

    CHORUS:
        I want time to rewind, 
        and send back my mind 
        to the girl I left behind so long ago, 
        you may think that I am dumb, 
        but I can hear my vortex hum, 
        and a change is gonna come, as time will show. 

    well, I know where I went wrong, known it all along, 
    I missed my chance and now I pay my dues, 
    looking for a sign, wishing you were mine, 
    I live my life, but not the way I choose. 

    you know, I'm quite aware how people point and stare, 
    they pretend my earnest mission is a joke, 
    you may think that I am lyin', but I saw agents from Orion 
    slippin' nano-probe tracers in my coke. 

    I think that I should mention 
    that I'm leaving this dimension 
    for chronetic intervention, if I may, 
    I will scream out my defiance 
    in the name of temporal science 
    and renew an old alliance in yesterday. 

    CHORUS

    I want time to rewind, 
    and send back my mind, 
    to the girl I left behind so long ago, 
    you may think that I'm insane, 
    but I will duplicate my brain 
    and put an end to all my pain, as time will show. 

    I can hear my vortex hum, 
    I'm going back to where I come from, 
    and a change is going come, 
    as time will show. 
    I want time to rewind, 
    and send me back where I can find 
    the friend I left behind 
    so long ago. 

    but, time... time will show.
