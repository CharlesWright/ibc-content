## Lyrics
    george came down to meet me the other day 
    just for a short vacation, he said he couldn't stay 
    he had to go back home to a distant galaxy 
    back to his home planet (he called it Planet Z) 

    he was a woodlouse 
    a rolly-poly with a giant brane 
    I fainted when I first saw him 
    because I thought I'd gone insane 

    but george would never hurt me 
    as he later would explain 
    to harm a sentient being 
    would cause him telepathic pain 

    george and I went walking the other day 
    we went out for a stroll and the hours flew away 
    he wanted conversation and enjoyed my company 
    he had never met a mammal back on Planet Z 

    'cause he's a woodlouse 
    a rolly-poly with a jointed shell 
    I fainted when I first saw him 
    but he turned out to be real swell 

    oh, george would never hurt me 
    it would put him through such hell 
    all he asked was my friendship 
    and to walk a little spell 

    (spoken):

    (I guess I should explain that technically, george wasn't really a pillbug, sowbug, rolly-poly, or any other kind of woodlouse, he just reminded me of one with his articulated carapace, beady, multifaceted eyes, and multiple legs. george explained to me that his people evolved from what we would call trilobites, which is a kind of paleozoic arthropod. but he never told me much more than that, because he suddenly shrieked with pleasure and ran over to a rotting log, which he began to munch on gleefully.)

    george said goodbye to me the other day 
    when we had finished walking and he had had his say 
    he thanked me for my hospitality 
    he told me I should someday visit Planet Z 

    and walk with woodlice 
    aliens with public speaking skill 
    I won't faint when I next see them 
    it will seem like such a thrill 

    george said he'd come back to get me 
    as he vanished up on that hill 
    and I really do believe that 
    if I wait for him, he will 
    it's been a week now since he left me 
    and I am waiting still
