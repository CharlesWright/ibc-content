The first two shows were on Friday and Saturday.  The Friday show was a little bit rough here and there but not bad.  I think we really hit it much better on Saturday

.  It was pretty much a full house and the energy was really good.  We start the pre-show with Mike's "Pink Noise" (lyrics are on the web site).  I will see if I can get a good live recording.  Next is George Hammond Conspiracy, followed by The Robot Song, (Data Version).  That gets people laughing every time.  We then do [Talysman](/talysman)'s [Pretending I'm Not There](/pretending-im-not-there) which is really strong.  The show then gets started and we do Senseless, [Chalice of Fire](/chalice-of-fire), and [COMAR](/comar) and key moments.  We then use my version of [Static Caravan Fan Club](/static-caravan-fan-club) as the background music during the break.

So far the audience seems to have enjoyed it.  Senseless always gets a great reaction.  The song has been tweaked to make it a duet between <lj user="fmyates"> and Rebecca making it particularly wrong when Rebecca sings parts from first person.

[Chalice Of Fire | Chalice](/chalice-of-fire-|-chalice) and [COMAR](/comar) get pretty surreal in the context of the show so it is hard to gauge the reaction since the show has gotten darker at that point and it is not really an applause situation.



People have been asking about where they can get albums and the music, so that is very cool.  I included a link in the program to my IBC site since it has the most up-to-date collection of MP3's and lyrics at this point.



Also I will post up the program we when I get it.  It includes acknowledgments for all the contributors including (but not limited to) [CaseyB](/caseyb) and [Talysman](/talysman).
