 # Kibo's Beard Wax

Lyrics: James "[Kibo](/kibo)" Parry's hair and beard product

Arrangement: [Charlie](/charlie)

Charlie's commentary:
>In a [posting](https://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.kibology/msg/36f75a616dfc3df6?dmode=source) about his current hair color, [Kibo](/kibo) set out a challenge to record a song based on the ingredients of his conditioner/wax (listed below). While he probably uses this on both his hair and beard, I liked the title of the song better this way.
