    spiral pathway, ancient hill, elderberry wine, 
    croquet players standing still, framed by leaves of green, 
    dwarflords clutching porno mags huddle in the loam, 
    someone wearing garbage bags just stole my garden gnome. 

    epochs of your hollow scene stretch into the chill, 
    whisp'ring winds of hallowe'en shiver down my spine 
    shrubs that count back through the years lead me to the dawn, 
    soothe my sorrow, dry my tears -- hey, wait, my wallet's gone. 

    Daedalus will now design a marvelous machine, 
    the piper king in full recline seeks passions to fulfill, 
    pretty damsel, set me free, look deep into my eyes, 
    I'd like to order -- let me see -- a hamburger and fries. 

    hamburger and fries, my love, 
    a hamburger and fries! 
    HAMBURGER! AND FRIES!
