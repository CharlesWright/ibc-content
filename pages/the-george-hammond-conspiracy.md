## Background

On June 30th, 2002, scientific divinity theorist George Hammond proclaimed thusly:

> "It took 4 years before Einstein's theory was recognized. I'm in my third year of publication (on the internet). That makes one year to go before I'm headline news in every newspaper in the world. "

Sadly, on June 30th, 2003, George Hammond was not headline news in every newspaper in the world. For those who wanted the truth - for those who could handle the truth - Interrobang Cartel released "The George Hammond Conspiracy" on that day.

## Lyrics

    When physics meets religion 
    there are sceptics all around 
    for some it's superstition 
    and for some it's holy ground 
    But George Hammond was a patient man 
    he churned and turned the sod 
    and in the earth he found the proof 
    the Scientific Proof of God 

    When physics meets religion 
    there are sets of rolling eyes 
    too hard to seek the truth of proof 
    too hard despising lies 
    but George found the solution 
    where no-one else had trod 
    the perfect space, the simple place, 
    the Scientific Proof of God 

    it's the George Hammond conspiracy 
    the truth that they won't let you see 
    GOD=Guv 
    no matter what they say 

    it's the George Hammond conspiracy 
    but behind the cloak of secrecy 
    GOD=Guv 
    it's always been that way 

    When commerce meets instruction 
    and commercials must be run 
    there are sponsors to be honoured 
    there are things that must be done 
    there are stories to be trumpeted 
    and stories to protect 
    but don't think we're not aware now 
    don't think we're not aware now 
    don't think we're not aware now 
    greater intellect 
    it's the Flynn Effect 

    When physics meets religion 
    there are secrets by the score 
    there are those with firm investments 
    in the politics of war 
    but before we trawl the deserts 
    with the high divining rod 
    we should think instead of what George said 
    the Scientific Proof of God 


    it's the George Hammond conspiracy 
    the truth that they won't let you see 
    GOD=Guv 
    no matter what they say 
    it's the George Hammond conspiracy 
    but behind the cloak of secrecy 
    GOD=Guv 
    it's Equation Of The Day 
    it's a brand new way to pray 
    and it's always been that way 

The George Hammond conspiracy continues to this day.
