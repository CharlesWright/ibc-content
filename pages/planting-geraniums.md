# Planting Geraniums

Lyrics: [Doctroid](/doctroid)

Arrangement: [Casey B](/casey-b)

Album: [The Last Da/The Crazy People's Supermarket](/the-last-days-of-the-crazy-peoples-supermarket)

In a discussion of [Needs More Wanger](/needs-more-wanger) on ARK, [Stacia](/stacia) (author of the [Pigskin Loofah](/pigskin-loofah) lyrics) wrote:

>I have no comment on "[Pigskin Loofah](/pigskin-loofah)", because I am still horrified that people used their mighty musical talents on lyrics so spectacularly lame. They could have been doing something useful, like playing solitaire, or planting geraniums, instead. 

[Doctroid](/doctroid) liked that last sentence and responded with lyrics for a song called "Planting Geraniums". Stacia responded:

       _________________

      |       YOU       |
      |      STINK      |
      |_________________|

which, coming from [Stacia](/stacia), is probably high praise.

## Lyrics
    They all irritate me
    Talking on their folding cell phones
    Instant message from the back row
    And they aren't really here

    They all irritate me
    With their precious little theories
    Make us happy little robots
    All with happy self esteem

       And they could have been
       Doing something useful
       Doing something useful
       Planting geraniums

    They annoy me now
    Driving like they're crazy
    Cross the double yellow
    Just to stop first at the light

    They annoy me now
    Standing clapping at the concerts
    Yelling when I'm trying to listen
    To the guys up on the stage

       And they could have been
       Doing something useful
       Doing something useful
       Planting geraniums

    They're all criminals
    Bleeding dry the corporation
    Hiding in corrupt accounting
    You won't take your pension home

    They're all criminals
    All their lies and their hypocrisy
    Amend the constitution
    Just to win one in the fall

       And they could have been
       Doing something useful
       Doing something useful
       Planting geraniums
