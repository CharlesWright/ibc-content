## Lyrics

By [Doctroid](/doctroid)

    When I was six
    I wanted to drive a garbage truck
    Remind me why
    I wanted to drive a garbage truck
    They're impressive machines
    But they smell
    And it's hard work
    For bad pay
    And no respect

    When I was twelve
    I wanted to be an astronaut
    Remind me why
    I wanted to be an astronaut
    It's the final frontier
    But the risk
    Is very high
    And you get
    Spacesick a lot

    When I was twenty
    I wanted to marry Emily
    Remind me why
    I wanted to marry Emily
    She was beautiful, yes
    But she had
    No brains at all
    And she had
    Expensive tastes

    When I was thirty
    I wanted to serve all of mankind
    Remind me why
    I wanted to serve all of mankind
    They're the image of God
    But they kill
    Lust after gold
    And hate what's
    Not understood

    When I was fifty-three
    I wanted to write down this song, yeah
    Remind me why
    I wanted to write down this song, yeah
    It''s a clever idea
    But it's long
    Too long in fact
    And the point
    Got lost somewhere
