In an entirely different newsgroup (alt.slack), someone expressed a desire to hear a song about an explosing at a pig parts processing plant entitled "Bacon All Over". Since it didn't look like anyone else was about to record this song, Talysman obliged. 

## Lyrics

    pig plant explosion! 
    swine are in the sky! 
    someone left the boiler runnin' 
    and now they've blown it sky high! 

    bacon all over, 
    rinds are on the ground, 
    such a shameful waste of pigmeat... 
    I think I'll pick up a pound. 

    I'd like some ham, little mama, 
    I'd eat some bacon every day, 
    so it's my good fortune 
    the plant blew up today. 

    bacon all over, 
    swine are in the sky! 
    someone sabotaged the pig-plant 
    and now they've blown it sky high! 

    (long-ish solo) 

    pig plant explosion! 
    swine are in the sky! 
    someone filled the air with bacon 
    and now we're all gonna fry! 

    bacon all over, 
    rinds are on the ground, 
    found some slabs of fatty goodness 
    just scattered all around 

    I'd like some ham, little mama, 
    I'd eat some bacon every day, 
    so it's my good fortune 
    the plant blew up today. 

    bacon all over, 
    swine are in the sky! 
    someone sabotaged the pig-plant 
    and now they've blown it sky high!
