## Lyrics
    well, I met a girl 
    made my head whirl, so I gave her a twirl 
    she was only sixteen 
    but I was, too, so I thought it was keen 

    but I didn't know 

    she was in it for the monkey origami 
    she was in it for the monkey origami 

    she wanted to fold what I wanted to hold 

    she was in it for the monkey origami 
    she was in it for the monkey origami 

    oh no, I'm her paper doll, 
    her launcelot link she can dress in pink 
    oh no, I'm a disposable toy, 
    her personal boy she only wants to annoy 

    well, I didn't know 
    love can flow in one direction you know 
    she was only kidding 
    she thought I was, too, thought it was only a fling 

    but she didn't know 

    I wasn't in it for the monkey origami 
    I wasn't in it for the monkey origami 

    us romantic apes don't want to make paper shapes 

    we're not in it for the monkey origami 
    we're not in it for the monkey origami 

    oh no, I'm a serious dQQd 
    I'm not a plaything with a ding-a-ling 
    oh no, I'm a serious guy 
    love makes me high, don't need to ask why 

    I'm not in it for the monkey origami 
    I'm not in it for the monkey origami 

    like some other apes are
