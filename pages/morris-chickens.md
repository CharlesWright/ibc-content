## Lyrics

    it was a morris chicken, so heavy in the sack 
    I tied up his beak, he let out a squeak 
    as I threw him across my back 
    I stole back to my humble home and tossed him in a cage 
    I swore that I would train him to dance 
    and put him on the stage 

    CHORUS: 

    have you never seen a chicken? 
    have you never seen a bird? 
    have you never seen old ladies gawk 
    and shout out "oh my word!" 
    if you buy a pint for me 
    and pull me up a chair, 
    I'll show you all my chicken 
    so you can point and stare. 

    I started out to teach him and freed him from his coop 
    he let out a squawk and jumped on my clock 
    and splattered me with poop 
    I tried to teach him capers but the bird was quite a fool 
    I swore that I would train him to dance 
    because it would be cool 

    (CHORUS) 

    I tried to teach him how to jump and how to hold a sword 
    I struggled to herd that idiot bird 
    across the bathroom floor 
    that chicken would not compromise or listen to my word 
    I swore that I would train him to dance 
    or strangle that old bird 

    (CHORUS) 

    I tried to teach him how to hold a hanky in his beak 
    I threatened to pluck the bitchy old cluck 
    and he pecked me on my cheek 
    I finally bought a chicken suit and went back on my word 
    for if I could not train him to dance 
    then I would be the bird 

    (CHORUS)
