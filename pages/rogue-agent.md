## Lyrics

    empty building, empty halls 
    bits of plaster on the floor 
    cracks in ceilings, cracks in walls 
    rats and vermin I ignore 

    now it's begun 
    gotta find my way inside 
    I'm on the run 
    and there's no where I can hide 
    rogue agent on the run 

    cybernetic gadgetry 
    is my savior, is my friend 
    engineering ancestry 
    gives advantage in the end 

    but it's begun 
    gotta find a place to hide 
    I'm on the run 
    and there's no one on my side 
    rogue agent on the run 

    when my masters turned on me 
    I had to vanish in the night 
    a clip of ammo and secrecy 
    are my only guiding light 

    and it's begun 
    gotta feeling deep inside 
    I'm on the run 
    and there's no where I can hide 
    now it's begun 
    gotta swallow all my pride 
    'cause I'm on the run 

    and there's no one on my side 
    rogue agent on the run 

    rogue agent 
    and there's no where I can hide 

    rogue agent 
    and there's no one on my side
