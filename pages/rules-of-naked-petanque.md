## Lyrics
    there is a greyhaired man in the duplex next door 
    he likes to play the petanque 
    he's kind of wild, that man, a rebel to the core 
    he's a regular bronc 
    decked out with gold and rings, 
    blue-haired ladies cackle whenever he sings 
    they don't seem disturbed by the naughty things 
    he does in naked petanque. 

    he says likes to toss his little balls around 
    when he plays naked petanque 
    hits the piglet hard 'cause he likes the sound 
    they make a satisfying plonk 
    he plays the game in the nude, 
    tells his lady friends it isn't really rude, 
    it's only the younger folks who come unglued 
    when he plays naked petanque 

    one day the landlady heard the greyhaired one 
    talk about naked petanque, 
    and she chastised him for all his pervish fun 
    and then he called her a wonk 
    experience has sealed his lips 
    now that the landlady has sunk all his ships 
    it wasn't fair to evict him or beat him with whips 
    all over naked petanque 
    and now he has to live in a retirement home 
    where he plays naked petanque 
    he still plays naked petanque
