In case anyone has tried to go to www.interrobangcartel.com and discovered that the site is down, please don't panic.

Our DNS servers changed and I didn't update the records by the deadline. I've changed them now, and the changes will propagate within the next 48 hours.

Until then, the site will still be available at interrobang.jwgh.org, if anyone needs it.  I know it's not getting heavy use right now, but certainly the MP3 page is still accessible.
