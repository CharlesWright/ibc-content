    Chorus:

    PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MAN BEHIND THE SCREEN!
    Ignore the furlax!
    You talkin' to me?
    Ignore the furlax!
    What is your major malfunction numb nuts? Didn't your parents pay you enough attention as a child?
    Ignore the furlax!

    The furlax is not worth your attention
    Do not regard it in any light
    It is no concern of yours
    What? Why am I telling you to ignore it?
    No reason...

    Chorus

    Why should you care about the furlax?
    What's my job you ask?
    It's telling people to ignore the furlax!
    It's a living...

    Chorus

    I have no idea why furlaxes must be ignored
    I just don't think about it that much
    I don't know why
    I've just got other things to think about...

    Chorus

    IGNORE THE FURLAX!
