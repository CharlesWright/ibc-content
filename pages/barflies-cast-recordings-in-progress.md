We did our first recording session on Sunday, and got a lot of work done on [Pink Noise](/pink-noise), [George Hammond](/george-hammond), [The Robot Song](/the-robot-song) and [Chalice of Fire](/chalice-of-fire).  Next up are [Senseless](/senseless) and [COMAR](/comar).



Hopefully we can schedule another session in a few weeks.  With some early rough mixing I can see that we will be able to have the recordings do a nice job of representing how we performed the songs for the show.
