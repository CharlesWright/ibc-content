# The Albums
There are a number of recorded Interrobang Cartel albums and more currently in the works or at least talked about:

* The first album, [Needs More Wanger](/needs-more-wanger), was officially released on 20 September 2003. 

* The second was [The Last Days Of The Crazy People's Supermarket](/the-last-days-of-the-crazy-peoples-supermarket), more or less released on 27 Oct 2004. 

* [Interrobang Cartel Tribute Album](/interrobang-cartel-tribute-album), an album of 'reverse covers', was proposed by [Casey B](/casey-b) on 6 May 2003 and was finally completed at the end of 2008. 

* Songs have been recorded for [Aspartame Placebo](/aspartame-placebo) and [Luxury Potato](/luxury-potato). Current thinking is that these will be two parts of a single album. 

* [Gokmop The Irrefrangible](/gokmop-the-irrefrangible) proposed an elaborate concept album, [Bad Coelacanth](/bad-coelacanth). 

* A [http://www.livejournal.com LiveJournal] meme gave rise to another proposed album, [Right of Reply](/right-of-reply). 

* There has been talk of a children's album, possibly to be titled either [Children of the Quorn](/children-of-the-quorn)(suggested by Not R) or [Through Siberian Fields of Cheese](/through-siberian-fields-of-cheese) (suggested by Gokmop the Irrefrangible). 

* [House Made of Awesomeness](/house-made-of-awesomeness) (suggested by Xaonon) is envisioned as a prog rock opus. 

* the album titles [Needs Less Wanger](/needs-less-wanger) and [The Album Is Behind You](/the-album-is-behind-you) have shown up in ID3 tags but have no official standing. 

* 3 or 4 to 3 or 15 is also claimed to be the second Interrobang Cartel album, although no tracks have been named yet. This probably can be written off as an unfounded rumor. 

* [The Barflies Soundtrack](/the-barflies-soundtrack) is a compilation of the songs performed for the [Barflies Show](/barflies-show) featuring cast performances.
