Lyrics: [TWillis](/twillis)

Arrangement: [Talysman](/talysman)



Album: [The Last Days Of The Crazy People's Supermarket](/the-last-days-of-the-crazy-peoples-supermarket)


Terri Willis (robot Terri, not meat Terri) wrote the following lyrics, which [Talysman](/talysman) later recorded, much to everyone's surprise. although the lyrics could have worked as a punk or metal tune, the final product turned out to be a sound collage-style composition, with sound sample's of [Talysman's](/talysman) voice under various distortions.
