## Lyrics

    I thought I did good 
    I got my name on telly 
    sent in my letter 
    they sent a badge to me 

    I was just a kid 
    but I felt neater 
    they showed my idea 
    on blue peter 

    it was me and a hundred other kids, yeah 
    but we earned our badges, yes we did, yeah 
    we thought we were famous, thought we'd made the scene 
    then they gave another badge to the freakin' queen 

    I thought I was good 
    I was a special breed 
    I got a big head 
    they had planted a seed 

    I went to med school 
    I felt cocksure 
    I fueled my ego 
    with exposure 

    it was me and a hundred other kids, yeah 
    but we earned our badges, yes we did, yeah 
    we thought we were famous, thought we'd made the scene 
    then they gave another badge to the freakin' queen 

    a gold blue peter badge for the freakin' queen 
    a gold blue peter badge for the freakin' queen
