# I'm Not a Tuba Player, But I Play One on TV

Lyrics: [swt](/swt), [Doctroid](/doctroid)

Arrangement: [Doctroid](/doctroid)

Additional vocals: [JWGH](/jwgh)

Album: [The Last Days Of The Crazy People's Supermarket](/the-last-days-of-the-crazy-peoples-supermarket)


In an ark thread called Kazoo Bands, [swt](/swt) responded to [Wiblur's](/wiblur) remark, 'I don't know anyone who plays tuba players either', with two verses and a chorus of 'A potential oom-pah drinking song "I'm not a tuba player, but I play one on TV", singable in something vaguely resembling iambic heptameter'. [Doctroid](/doctroid) eventually followed [swt's](/swt) instructions to add another verse or two -- specifically, he wrote two -- and then recorded it.

[Doctroid](/doctroid) realized he was going to have to do this the moment he figured out how to use Crystal to play sampled tuba in GarageBand. He characterizes the song as Polka Electronica, with additional influences from Gordon Lightfoot and Keith Emerson. And if that doesn't make any sense, this song has succeeded.

Zip Drive Click of Deth provided backing vocals.

## Lyrics

    I'm not a tuba player, but I play one on TV
    I'm not a tuba player, but I play one on TV
    I don't act like an actor, but I'm in the SAG
    I've never starred in Hamelet, but I am a little ham
    I'm not Popeye or the son of God, but I am what I am. 

    Chorus:
       I was never lying when I said I would be true
       And I won't pretend that I am not in love with you

    I stand before you naked (metaphorically, of course)
    There's no sticker on my Geo saying that my other car's a Porsche
    I'm not a chimney cleaner, though I've come down with the flu
    I'm not a latin lover, but ego amare you

    Chorus

    If you could read my mind, oh, what a tale my thoughts would tell
    I'd give you earth and heaven but you'd probably give me hell
    I'm good at taking bad advice and bad at taking hints
    Kiss me and I will not turn into a handsome prince

    Chorus

    I won't discuss your politics and won't bore you with mine
    If you're nice to my lager then I won't insult your wine
    I've never been a roadie but I'll always take a stand
    I only wish that I could play a tuba in a band

    Chorus
