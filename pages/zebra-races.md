# Lyrics
    the other day at the hippodrome 
    I saw Chapman, Burchell and Grant 
    Grant and Burchell were dressed in lace 
    Chapman's hat was at a slant 

    they came to watch the races 
    they watch them every day 
    they bet money on the ponies 
    and they paint them brown and grey, brown and grey 

    the other day at the crosswalk 
    I saw a man who nearly died 
    I saw his pedestrian deposit 
    and the policeman nearly cried 

    he came to watch the races 
    he has to watch them every day 
    he takes money from the drivers 
    and he paints them brown and grey, brown and grey 

    the other day at the museum 
    I saw a tiger moth displayed 
    the stripes looped across its belly 
    and it made me feel afraid 

    it came to fly in the races 
    it has to fly there every day 
    it takes money from the people 
    and it paints them brown and grey, brown and grey
