# Major Zed
Major Zed has been traversing the spaces between ambient electronic and psychedelic electro-pop since Y2K. His vocal work has been compared to David Bowie, David Byrne, and Thomas Dolby; his instrumental work to Tricky, The Orb, Aphex Twin, Pink Floyd and Frank Zappa (as in, "He's no Frank Zappa").

Until he started collaborating with [Doctroid](/doctroid), Major Zed was responsible for all aspects of his music: composing, arranging, keyboards, electric guitar, synthesizers, vocals, drum programming, loop programming, producing, and engineering. Now he disavows any responsibility for work that appears on IBC.


Major Zed lives on a hilltop in rural Connecticut (USA) with his wife Dee Dee (the Moon Goddess).

Major Zed and [Doctroid](/doctroid) go waaaaaaay back.
