# Doctroid

DOCTROID, or more fully Doctroid Doctroid Holmes, joined Interrobang Cartel soon after the release of the first album, [Needs More Wanger](/needs-more-wanger). He brings a much-needed sense of relativistic invariance to the lineup. As lead melodeon player for Thornden Morris he has honed his musical skills right down to a nubbin, as a brief listen (as brief as possible) to his recordings will soon reveal.
