# Editors at War 

Lyrics: [Plorkwort](/plorkwort)

Arrangement: [jwgh](/jwgh)

Album: [The Last Days Of The Crazy People's Supermarket](/the-last-days-of-the-crazy-peoples-supermarket)

[Matt Mc Irvin](/matt-mc-irvin) and [Beable van Polasm](/beable-van-polasm) got into a discussion about the Macintosh text editor BBedit and emacs, leading [Plorkwort](/plorkwort) to write the following ballad, which [jwgh](/jwgh) then recorded. Finally, [Ben Wolfson](/ben-wolfson) suggested adding a brief, plinky guitar solo at the end, and [jwgh](/jwgh) made it so.


## Lyrics

    The night was dark and storms were near, 
    And thunder shook the floor. 
    The turbid air was filled with fear, 
    And editors at war. 

    With one fell macro, a paragraph filled 
    And BBedit roared; 
    And in gnus a poster was killed 
    In a single keychord. 

    Throughout the night, the titans clashed 
    And only dawn would see 
    If BBEdit crashed, by emacs bashed 
    Or who would the victor be.
