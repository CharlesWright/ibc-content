## Lyrics
    Your shit it stinks
    It's freezer cold
    White collar bimbo
    Corporate limbo 

    Fucking wicker furniture and doilies
    Doesn't hide a soul that's oily 

    You chap my ass
    Like a pigskin loofah 

    College graduate
    Hotel management
    Put your change
    In your 401K 

    Investment brokers are portfolio pimps
    Internet wunderkinds with the brains of chimps 

    You chap my ass
    Like a pigskin loofah 

    SCRUBBIE! SCRUBBIE! SCRUBBIE! SCRUBBIE!
    LOOFAH! LOOFAH! LOOFAH! LOOFAH!
    CLEANSE MY SOUL!
    CLEANSE MY SOUL! 

    Little bo pig won't you come out and play 

    PIGGIE! PIGGIE! PIGGIE! PIGGIE! 

    Need the power of the pig to exfoliate my mind 

    LOOFAH! LOOFAH! LOOFAH! LOOFAH! 

    CLEANSE MY SOUL!
    CLEANSE MY SOUL!
