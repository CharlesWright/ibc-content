## Lyrics

    Love is the final frontier,
    a brave and exciting idea;
    the feeling is indubitably true,
    though the logic's unclear.

    I know love uncovers your soul,
    of your heart surrenders control;
    it turns friendships to duels, princes to fools,
    it can swallow you whole.

    So how,
    in the face of it now,
    can I cope with my heartbeat in rhythm with yours?

    Why,
    with my logical mind,
    can I no longer point out its rational flaws?

    This must be evidence of
    a much greater force from above
    that so compels me to go where I've not gone (before):
    boldly falling in love, boldly falling in love.
