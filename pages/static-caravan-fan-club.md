## Lyrics

(spoken word over creepy cellos)

Oh, yes, and strains caused by my anti-godism. I am not concerned with one of the dead or their sore-losers' malevolence, they have tried to attach themselves to me in a dysfunctional static caravan fan club...

Oh, yes, and I have long been a non-flaming poster--as clueless as I am by definition; that means your reality as you see in my "fan club" or feel in the distinction between alt.usenet.kooks regulars and the "kooks" whose static words entertain the regulars, is strictly illusory anyway, so I don't think *anyone*, even the most famous human cockroach or caravan fans, dives under your misconceptions...

Oh, yes, and strains can spread confusion and lack of western words to entertain the regulars. And there were voices, and the "kooks" whose static words entertain the mind of lost references. Please allow my static caravan fan club to congratulate myself on the table.

Oh, yes, and bolt your doors, caravan fans, and dive under your bed, 'cause we're sure as hell ain't going to kiss you if you read my articles of the dead, that troubling distinction between your misconceptions about a sore-losers' malevolence and a city that is like unto a hat. Further--and this point is key for me as a net writer--is that you don't own salt.

Oh, yes, and someone may be responding to someone's perverted fantasy about me with my "Flame Giant". I can feel the lead. There is no question (by anyone's counting) that I stopped using the figures for the "big hairy man" persona because it involves devising comic results with my eyes.

Oh, yes, and bolt your doors, caravan fans, and listen to the thunderings. Bolt your doors, dive under your beds. Please allow my static caravan fan club to kiss you... a champion writer will vanish into a hat.
