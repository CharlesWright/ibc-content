## Barflies - Second Shot

This the name of the revival/update of the original Barflies show done as part of the Philly Fringe Festival.  The purpose of the this show in addition to allowing more people see our awesome production is to become eligable for consideration of a Barrymore theater award.  Part of the requires are performing at least 12 shows, and the actors must be paid at some minimum standard (or more).

The show is scheduled to play the the last three weekends of April including Friday, Saturday and Sunday of each.

The show ran 45 minutes with a 15 minute musical pre-show.

The original song set will likely remain but perhaps be expanded with additonal actiing material as well to create an hour long show.
