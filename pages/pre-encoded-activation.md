## Lyrics

    So you think you really know you
    'til the day comes that will show you
    What the multiverse might owe you
    Is a kick right in the head

    You behold the exposition
    Of the xeno-inquisition
    And your precious prime position
    Is a zeppelin of lead

    Once you thought you'd beat the dealer
    But now Everett and Wheeler
    Not to mention Edith Keeler
    Teach a lesson you must learn

    This and that is both and neither
    And there's no such thing as either
    Just ask Lachesis the weaver [1]
    Every time you take a turn

    Activate
    Now it all comes flooding back
    Activate
    Decompress unzip unpack
    Activate
    And it's comfy as the rack
    Activation

    Now you know who you are really
    Through a rite not touchy-feely
    But more like they did a wheelie
    On your parietal lobe

    Like a blend of Margaret Mead and
    Something thought up by Joss Whedon
    It's an insight big as Sweden
    In the quick flash of a strobe

    Activate!
